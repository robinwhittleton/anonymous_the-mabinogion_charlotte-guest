7</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>This third volume completes the series of Mabinogion and tales
translated by Lady Charlotte Guest.</p>
<p>As in the two preceding volumes, I have compared Lady
Guest&rsquo;s transcript with the original text in the Red Book
of Hergest, and with Dr Gwenogvryn Evans&rsquo; scrupulously
accurate diplomatic edition.&nbsp; I have, as before, revised the
translation as carefully as I could.&nbsp; I have not altered
Lady Guest&rsquo;s version in the slightest degree; but I have
again put in the form of foot-notes what seems to me to be a
better or a more literal translation.&nbsp; The mistranslations
are fairly few in number; but some of them are quite important,
such as the references to pagan baptism or to the Irish
Channel.&nbsp; At the end of my revision I may say that I have
been struck by the comparative accuracy of the transcript of the
Red Book which Lady Guest used, and by the accurate thoroughness
with which she translated every one of the tales.</p>
<p>This volume contains the oldest of the Mabinogion&mdash;the
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>four branches of the Mabinogion proper&mdash;and the
kindred tale of Lludd and Llevelys.&nbsp; In all these we are in
a perfectly pagan atmosphere, neither the introduction of
Christianity nor the growth of chivalry having affected them to
any extent.</p>
<p>The Story of Taliesin is the only one in the series that is
not found in the Red Book of Hergest.&nbsp; It is taken from very
much later manuscripts, and its Welsh is much more modern.&nbsp;
Its subject, however, is akin to that of the Mabinogion proper;
if, indeed, the contest between Elphin and the bards is an echo
of the contest between decaying Paganism and growing
Christianity.</p>

11</span>PWYLL PRINCE OF DYVED.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Pwyll, prince of Dyved, was lord of the seven Cantrevs of
Dyved; and once upon a time he was at Narberth his chief palace,
and he was minded to go and hunt, and the part of his dominions
in which it pleased him to hunt was Glyn Cuch.&nbsp; So he set
forth from Narberth that night, and went as far as Llwyn Diarwyd.
<a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; And that night he tarried there,
and early <a name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a> on the morrow he rose and came to Glyn
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Cuch; when he let loose the dogs in the wood, and
sounded the horn, and began the chace.&nbsp; And as he followed
the dogs, he lost his companions; and whilst he listened to the
hounds, he heard the cry of other hounds, a cry different from
his own, and coming in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>And he beheld a glade in the wood forming a level plain, and
as his dogs came to the edge of the glade, he saw a stag before
the other dogs.&nbsp; And lo, as it reached the middle of the
glade, the dogs that followed the stag overtook it, and brought
it down.&nbsp; Then looked he at the colour of the dogs, staying
not to look at the stag, and of all the hounds that he had seen
in the world, he had never seen any that were like unto
those.&nbsp; For their hair was of a brilliant shining white, and
their ears were red; and as the whiteness of their bodies shone,
so did the redness of their ears glisten.&nbsp; And he came
towards the dogs, and drove away those that had brought down the
stag, and set his own dogs upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p13.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p13.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And as he was setting on his dogs, he saw a horseman coming
towards him upon a large light grey steed, with a hunting horn
about his neck, and clad in garments of grey woollen in the
fashion of a hunting garb.&nbsp; And the horseman drew near and
spoke unto him thus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chieftain,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I know who thou art, and I greet thee not.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Peradventure,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;thou art of such
dignity that thou shouldest not do so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;it is not my dignity
that prevents me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it then, O
chieftain?&rdquo; asked he.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Heaven, it is by
reason of thine own ignorance and want of courtesy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What discourtesy, Chieftain, hast thou seen in
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Greater discourtesy saw I never in
man,&rdquo; <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>said he, &ldquo;than to drive away
the dogs that were killing the stag, and to set upon it thine
own.&nbsp; This was discourteous, and though I may not be
revenged upon thee, yet I declare to Heaven that I will do thee
more dishonour than the value of an hundred stags.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;O chieftain,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if I have done ill
I will redeem thy friendship.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How wilt thou
redeem it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;According as thy dignity may be,
but I know not who thou art?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A crowned King
am I in the land whence I come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;may the day prosper with thee, and from what land
comest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From Annwvyn,&rdquo; answered
he; &ldquo;Arawn, a King of Annwvyn, <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a> am I.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how may I gain thy
friendship?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;After this <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>manner mayest
thou,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a man whose dominions
are opposite to mine, who is ever warring against me, and he is
Havgan, a King of Annwvyn, and by ridding me of this oppression
which thou canst easily do shalt thou gain my
friendship.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly will I do this,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;show me how I may.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
show thee.&nbsp; Behold thus it is thou mayest.&nbsp; I will make
firm friendship with thee; and this will I do, I will send thee
to Annwvyn in my stead, and I will give thee the fairest lady
thou didst ever behold, to be thy companion, and I will put my
form and semblance upon thee, so that not a page of the chamber,
nor an officer, nor any other man that has always followed me
shall know that it is not I.&nbsp; And this shall be for the
space of a year from to-morrow, and then will we meet in this
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but when I
shall have been there for the space of a year, by what means
shall I discover him of whom thou speakest?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;One year from this night,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is
the time fixed between him and me, that we should meet at the
Ford; be thou there in my likeness, and with one stroke that thou
givest him, he shall no longer live.&nbsp; And if he ask thee to
give him another, give it not, how much soever he may entreat
thee, for when I did so, he fought with me next day as well as
ever before.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Pwyll,
&ldquo;what shall I do concerning my kingdom?&rdquo;&nbsp; Said
Arawn, &ldquo;I will cause that no one in all thy dominions,
neither man, nor woman, shall know that I am not thou, and I will
go there in thy stead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly then,&rdquo;
said Pwyll, &ldquo;will I set forward.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Clear
shall be thy path and nothing shall detain thee, until thou come
into my dominions, and I myself will be thy guide!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>So he conducted him until he came in sight of the palace
and its dwellings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the Court and the kingdom in thy power.&nbsp; Enter the
Court, there is no one there who will know thee, and when thou
seest <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> what service is done there, thou wilt
know the customs of the Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went forward to the Court, and when he came there, he
beheld sleeping rooms, and halls, and chambers, and the most
beautiful buildings ever seen.&nbsp; And he went into the hall to
disarray, and there came youths and pages and disarrayed him, and
all as they entered saluted him.&nbsp; And two knights came and
drew his hunting dress from about him, and clothed him in a
vesture of silk and gold.&nbsp; And the hall was prepared, and
behold he saw the household and the host enter in, and the host
was the most comely and the best equipped that he had ever
seen.&nbsp; And with them came in likewise the Queen, who was the
fairest woman that he ever yet beheld.&nbsp; And she had on a
yellow robe of shining satin; and they washed and went to the
table, and they sat, the Queen upon one side of him, and one who
seemed to be an Earl on the other side.</p>
<p>And he began to speak with the Queen, and he thought from her
speech, that she was the seemliest, and most noble lady of
converse and of cheer that ever was.&nbsp; And they partook of
meat, and drink, with songs, and with feasting; and of all the
Courts upon the earth, behold this was the best supplied with
food and drink, and vessels of gold and royal jewels.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And the year he spent in hunting, and minstrelsy, <!-- page
16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and
feasting, and diversions, and discourse with his companions,
until the night that was fixed for the conflict.&nbsp; And when
that night came, it was remembered even by those who lived in the
farthest part of his dominions, and he went to the meeting, and
the nobles of the kingdom with him.&nbsp; And when he came to the
Ford, a knight arose and spake thus, &ldquo;Lords,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;listen well.&nbsp; It is between two Kings that this
meeting is, and between them only.&nbsp; Each claimeth of the
other his land and territory, and do all of you stand aside and
leave the fight to be between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p16.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p16.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Thereupon the two Kings approached each other in the middle of
the Ford, and encountered, and at the first thrust, the man who
was in the stead of Arawn struck Havgan on the centre of the boss
of his shield, so that it was cloven in twain, and his armour was
broken, and Havgan himself was borne to the ground an arm&rsquo;s
and a spear&rsquo;s length over the crupper of his horse, and he
received a deadly blow.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Chieftain,&rdquo; said
Havgan, &ldquo;what right hast thou to cause my death?&nbsp; I
was not injuring thee in any <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>thing, and I
know not wherefore thou wouldest slay me.&nbsp; But for the love
of Heaven, since thou hast begun to slay me, complete thy
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, Chieftain,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;I may yet repent doing that unto thee.&nbsp; Slay thee who
may, I will not do so.&rdquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;My
trusty Lords,&rdquo; said Havgan, &ldquo;bear me hence.&nbsp; My
death has come.&nbsp; I shall be no more able to uphold
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My Nobles,&rdquo; also said he who was
in the semblance of Arawn, &ldquo;take counsel and know who ought
to be my subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said the
Nobles, &ldquo;all should be, for there is no King over the whole
of Annwvyn but thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;it is right that he who comes humbly should be received
graciously, but he that doth not come with obedience, shall be
compelled by the force of swords.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he
received the homage of the men, and he began to conquer the
country; and the next day by noon the two kingdoms were in his
power.&nbsp; And thereupon he went to keep his tryst, and came to
Glyn Cuch.</p>
<p>And when he came there, the king of Annwvyn was there to meet
him, and each of them was rejoiced to see the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Arawn, &ldquo;may Heaven reward thee
for thy friendship towards me, I have heard of it.&nbsp; When
thou comest thyself to thy dominions,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou
wilt see that which I have done for thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever thou hast done for me, may Heaven repay it
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Arawn gave to Pwyll Prince of Dyved his proper form and
semblance, and he himself took his own; and Arawn set forth
towards the Court of <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Annwvyn; and he was rejoiced when he
beheld his hosts, and his household, whom he had not seen so
long; but they had not known of his absence, and wondered no more
at his coming than usual.&nbsp; And that day was spent in joy and
merriment; and he sat and conversed with his wife and his
nobles.&nbsp; And when it was time for them rather to sleep than
to carouse, they went to rest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Pwyll, Prince of Dyved, came likewise to his country and
dominions, and began to enquire of the nobles of the land, how
his rule had been during the past year, compared with what it had
been before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;thy
wisdom was never so great, and thou wert never so kind nor so
free in bestowing thy gifts, and thy justice was never more
worthily seen than in this year.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By
Heaven,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for all the good you have enjoyed,
you should thank him who hath been with you; for behold, thus
hath this matter been.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon Pwyll related
the whole unto them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, Lord,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;render thanks unto Heaven that thou hast such a
fellowship, and withhold not from us the rule which we have
enjoyed for this year past.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I take Heaven to
witness that I will not withhold it,&rdquo; answered Pwyll.</p>
<p>And thenceforth they made strong the friendship that was
between them, and each sent unto the other horses, and
greyhounds, and hawks, and all such jewels as they thought would
be pleasing to each other.&nbsp; And by reason of his having
dwelt that year in Annwvyn, and having ruled there so
prosperously, and united the two kingdoms in one day by his
valour and prowess, he lost the name of Pwyll Prince <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of
Dyved, and was called Pwyll Chief of Annwvyn from that time
forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Pwyll was at Narberth his chief palace,
where a feast had been prepared for him, and with him was a great
host of men.&nbsp; And after the first meal, Pwyll arose to walk,
and he went to the top of a mound that was above the palace, and
was called Gorsedd Arberth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said one of
the Court, &ldquo;it is peculiar to the mound that whosoever sits
upon it cannot go thence, without either receiving wounds or
blows, or else seeing a wonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear not to
receive wounds and blows in the midst of such a host as this, but
as to the wonder, gladly would I see it.&nbsp; I will go
therefore and sit upon the mound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And upon the mound he sat.&nbsp; And while he sat there, they
saw a lady, on a pure white horse of large size, with a garment
of shining gold around her, coming along the high way that led
from the mound; and the horse seemed to move at a slow and even
pace, and to be coming up towards the mound.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
men,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;is there any among you who knows
yonder lady?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is not, Lord,&rdquo; said
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go one of you and meet her, that we may know
who she is.&rdquo;&nbsp; And one of them arose, and as he came
upon the road to meet her, she passed by, and he followed as fast
as he could, being on foot; and the greater was his speed, the
further was she from him.&nbsp; And when he saw that it profited
him nothing to follow her, he returned to Pwyll, and said unto
him, &ldquo;Lord, it is idle for any one in the world to follow
her on foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Pwyll,
&ldquo;go unto the palace, and take the fleetest horse that thou
seest, and go after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>And he took a horse and went forward.&nbsp; And he came
to an open level plain, and put spurs to his horse; and the more
he urged his horse, the further was she from him.&nbsp; Yet she
held the same pace as at first.&nbsp; And his horse began to
fail; and when his horse&rsquo;s feet failed him, he returned to
the place where Pwyll was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;it will avail nothing for any one to follow yonder
lady.&nbsp; I know of no horse in these realms swifter than this,
and it availed me not to pursue her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a
truth,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;there must be some illusion
here.&nbsp; Let us go towards the palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; So to the
palace they went, and they spent that day.&nbsp; And the next day
they arose, and that also they spent until it was time to go to
meat.&nbsp; And after the first meal, &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said
Pwyll, &ldquo;we will go the same party as yesterday to the top
of the mound.&nbsp; And do thou,&rdquo; said he to one of his
young men, &ldquo;take the swiftest horse that thou knowest in
the field.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus did the young man.&nbsp; And
they went towards the mound, taking the horse with them.&nbsp;
And as they were sitting down they beheld the lady on the same
horse, and in the same apparel, coming along the same road.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;here is the lady of
yesterday.&nbsp; Make ready, youth, to learn who she
is.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that will
I gladly do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon the lady came opposite to
them.&nbsp; So the youth mounted his horse; and before he had
settled himself in his saddle, she passed by, and there was a
clear space between them.&nbsp; But her speed was no greater than
it had been the day before.&nbsp; Then he put his horse into an
amble, and thought that notwithstanding the gentle pace at which
his horse went, he should soon overtake her.&nbsp; But this
availed him not; so he gave <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>his horse the
reins.&nbsp; And still he came no nearer to her than when he went
at a foot&rsquo;s pace.&nbsp; And the more he urged his horse,
the further was she from him.&nbsp; Yet she rode not faster than
before.&nbsp; When he saw that it availed not to follow her, he
returned to the place where Pwyll was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;the horse can no more than thou hast
seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see indeed that it avails not that
any one should follow her.&nbsp; And by Heaven,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;she must needs have an errand to some one in this plain,
if her haste would allow her to declare it.&nbsp; Let us go back
to the palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to the palace they went, and they
spent that night in songs and feasting, as it pleased them.</p>
<p>And the next day they amused themselves until it was time to
go to meat.&nbsp; And when meat was ended, Pwyll said,
&ldquo;Where are the hosts that went yesterday and the day before
to the top of the mound?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, Lord, we are
here,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to the mound, to sit there.&nbsp; And do thou,&rdquo; said
he to the page who tended his horse, &ldquo;saddle my horse well,
and hasten with him to the road, and bring also my spurs with
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the youth did thus.&nbsp; And they went
and sat upon the mound; and ere they had been there but a short
time, they beheld the lady coming by the same road, and in the
same manner, and at the same pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo;
said Pwyll, &ldquo;I see the lady coming; give me my
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; And no sooner had he mounted his horse than
she passed him.&nbsp; And he turned after her and followed
her.&nbsp; And he let his horse go bounding playfully, and
thought that at the second step or the third he should come up
with her.&nbsp; But he came no nearer to her than at first.&nbsp;
Then he <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>urged his horse to his utmost speed,
yet he found that it availed nothing to follow her.&nbsp; Then
said Pwyll, &ldquo;O maiden, for the sake of him whom thou best
lovest, stay for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will stay
gladly,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and it were better for thy horse
hadst thou asked it long since.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the maiden
stopped, and she threw back that part of her head dress which
covered her face.&nbsp; And she fixed her eyes upon him, and
began to talk with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; asked he,
&ldquo;whence comest thou, and whereunto dost thou
journey?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I journey on mine own errand,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;and right glad am I to see thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;My greeting be unto thee,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; Then he
thought that the beauty of all the maidens, and all the ladies
that he had ever seen, was as nothing compared to her
beauty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wilt thou tell
me aught concerning thy purpose?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell
thee,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;My chief quest was to seek
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;this
is to me the most pleasing quest on which thou couldst have come;
and wilt thou tell me who thou art?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
tell thee, Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am Rhiannon, the
daughter of Heveydd H&ecirc;n, and they sought to give me to a
husband against my will.&nbsp; But no husband would I have, and
that because of my love for thee, neither will I yet have one
unless thou reject me.&nbsp; And hither have I come to hear thy
answer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By Heaven,&rdquo; said Pwyll,
&ldquo;behold this is my answer.&nbsp; If I might choose among
all the ladies and damsels in the world, thee would I
choose.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;If
thou art thus minded, make a pledge to meet me ere I am given to
another.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The sooner I may do so, the more
pleasing will it be unto me,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;and
wheresoever thou wilt, there will I meet with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;I will that thou meet me this day twelvemonth at
the palace of Heveydd.&nbsp; And I will cause a feast to be
prepared, so that it be ready against thou come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will I keep this
tryst.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;remain
in health, and be mindful that thou keep thy promise; and now
will I go hence.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they parted, and he went back to
his hosts and to them of his household.&nbsp; And whatsoever
questions they asked him respecting the damsel, he always turned
the discourse upon other matters.&nbsp; And when a year from that
time was gone, he caused a hundred knights to equip themselves
and to go with him to the palace of Heveydd H&ecirc;n.&nbsp; And
he came to the palace, and there was great joy concerning him,
with much concourse of people and great rejoicing, and vast
preparations for his coming.&nbsp; And the whole court was placed
under his orders.</p>
<p>And the hall was garnished and they went to meat, and thus did
they sit; Heveydd H&ecirc;n was on one side of Pwyll, and
Rhiannon on the other.&nbsp; And all the rest according to their
rank.&nbsp; And they eat and feasted and talked one with another,
and at the beginning of the carousal after the meat, there
entered a tall auburn-haired youth, of royal bearing, clothed in
a garment of satin.&nbsp; And when he came into the hall, he
saluted Pwyll and his companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The greeting of
Heaven be unto thee, my soul,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;come thou
and sit down.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a
suitor am I, and I will do mine errand.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do so
willingly,&rdquo; said Pwyll.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;my errand is unto thee, and it is to crave a boon of thee
that I come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What boon soever thou mayest ask
of me, as far as I am able, thou shall have.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Rhiannon, &ldquo;Wherefore didst thou give
that answer?&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>&ldquo;Has he
not given it before the presence of these nobles?&rdquo; asked
the youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;My soul,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;what
is the boon thou askest?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The lady whom best I
love is to be thy bride this night; I come to ask her of thee,
with the feast and the banquet that are in this
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Pwyll was silent because of the answer
which he had given.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be silent as long as thou
wilt,&rdquo; said Rhiannon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never did man make worse
use of his wits than thou hast done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I knew not who he
was.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, this is the man to whom they
would have given me against my will,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And he is Gwawl the son of Clud, a man of great power and
wealth, and because of the word thou hast spoken, bestow me upon
him lest shame befall thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I understand not thine answer.&nbsp; Never can I do as
thou sayest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bestow me upon him,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;and I will cause that I shall never be
his.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By what means will that be?&rdquo; asked
Pwyll.&nbsp; &ldquo;In thy hand will I give thee a small
bag,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;See that thou keep it well,
and he will ask of thee the banquet, and the feast, and the
preparations which are not in thy power.&nbsp; Unto the hosts and
the household will I give the feast.&nbsp; And such will be thy
answer respecting this.&nbsp; And as concerns myself, I will
engage to become his bride this night twelvemonth.&nbsp; And at
the end of the year be thou here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
bring this bag with thee, and let thy hundred knights be in the
orchard up yonder.&nbsp; And when he is in the midst of joy and
feasting, come thou in by thyself, clad in ragged garments, and
holding thy bag in thy hand, and ask nothing but a bagfull of
food, and I will cause that if all the meat and liquor that are
in these seven Cantrevs were put into it, it would be no fuller
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>than before.&nbsp; And after a great deal has been put
therein, he will ask thee, whether thy bag will ever be
full.&nbsp; Say thou then that it never will, until a man of
noble birth and of great wealth arise and press the food in the
bag, with both his feet saying, &lsquo;Enough has been put
therein;&rsquo; and I will cause him to go and tread down the
food in the bag, and when he does so, turn thou the bag, so that
he shall be up over his head in it, and then slip a knot upon the
thongs of the bag.&nbsp; Let there be also a good bugle horn
about thy neck, and as soon as thou hast bound him in the bag,
wind thy horn, and let it be a signal between thee and thy
knights.&nbsp; And when they hear the sound of the horn, let them
come down upon the palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said
Gwawl, &ldquo;it is meet that I have an answer to my
request.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As much of that thou hast asked as
it is in my power to give, thou shalt have,&rdquo; replied
Pwyll.&nbsp; &ldquo;My soul,&rdquo; said Rhiannon unto him,
&ldquo;as for the feast and the banquet that are here, I have
bestowed them upon the men of Dyved, and the household, and the
warriors that are with us.&nbsp; These can I not suffer to be
given to any.&nbsp; In a year from to-night a banquet shall be
prepared for thee in this palace, that I may become thy
bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Gwawl went forth to his possessions, and Pwyll went also
back to Dyved.&nbsp; And they both spent that year until it was
the time for the feast at the palace of Heveydd H&ecirc;n.&nbsp;
Then Gwawl the son of Clud set out to the feast that was prepared
for him, and he came to the palace, and was received there with
rejoicing.&nbsp; Pwyll, also, the chief of Annwn came to the
orchard with his hundred knights, as Rhiannon had commanded him,
having the bag with him.&nbsp; And Pwyll was clad in coarse and
ragged garments, and wore <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>large clumsy
old shoes upon his feet.&nbsp; And when he knew that the carousal
after the meat had begun, he went towards the hall, and when he
came into the hall, he saluted Gwawl the son of Clud, and his
company, both men and women.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven prosper
thee,&rdquo; said Gwawl, &ldquo;and the greeting of Heaven be
unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;May
Heaven reward thee, I have an errand unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Welcome be thine errand, and if thou ask of me that which
is just, thou shalt have it gladly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
fitting,&rdquo; answered he. <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I crave
but from want, and the boon that I ask is to have this small bag
that thou seest filled with meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A request
within reason is this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and gladly shalt
thou have it.&nbsp; Bring him food.&rdquo;&nbsp; A great number
of attendants arose and begun to fill the bag, but for all that
they put into it, it was no fuller than at first.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
soul,&rdquo; said Gwawl, &ldquo;will thy bag be ever
full?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It will not, I declare to
Heaven,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for all that may be put into it,
unless one possessed of lands, and domains, and treasure, shall
arise and tread down with both his feet the food that is within
the bag, and shall say, &lsquo;Enough has been put
herein.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Rhiannon unto Gwawl the son
of Clud, &ldquo;Rise up quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
willingly arise,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; So he rose up, and put his
two feet into the bag.&nbsp; And Pwyll turned up the sides of the
bag, so that Gwawl was over his head in it.&nbsp; And he shut it
up quickly and slipped a knot upon the thongs, and blew his
horn.&nbsp; And thereupon behold his household came down upon the
palace.&nbsp; And they seized all the host that had come with
Gwawl, and cast them into his own <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>prison.&nbsp;
And Pwyll threw off his rags, and his old shoes, and his tattered
array; and as they came in, every one of Pwyll&rsquo;s knights
struck a blow upon the bag, and asked, &ldquo;What is
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A Badger,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; And
in this manner they played, each of them striking the bag, either
with his foot or with a staff.&nbsp; And thus played they with
the bag.&nbsp; Every one as he came in asked, &ldquo;What game
are you playing at thus?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The game of Badger
in the Bag,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; And then was the game of
Badger in the Bag first played.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said the man in the bag, &ldquo;If thou
wouldest but hear me, I merit not to be slain in a
bag.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Heveydd H&ecirc;n, &ldquo;Lord, he speaks
truth.&nbsp; It were fitting that thou listen to him, for he
deserves not this.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Pwyll,
&ldquo;I will do thy counsel concerning him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold this is my counsel then,&rdquo; said Rhiannon;
&ldquo;Thou art now in a position in which it behoves thee to
satisfy suitors and minstrels, let him give unto them in thy
stead, and take a pledge from him that he will never seek to
revenge that which has been done to him.&nbsp; And this will be
punishment enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do this
gladly,&rdquo; said the man in the bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;And gladly
will I accept it,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;since it is the
counsel of Heveydd and Rhiannon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Such then is
our counsel,&rdquo; answered they.&nbsp; &ldquo;I accept
it,&rdquo; said Pwyll.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seek thyself
sureties.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We will be for him,&rdquo; said
Heveydd, &ldquo;until his men be free to answer for
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And upon this he was let out of the bag, and
his liegemen were liberated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Demand now of Gwawl his
sureties,&rdquo; said Heveydd, &ldquo;we know which should be
taken for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Heveydd numbered the
sureties.&nbsp; Said Gwawl, &ldquo;Do thou thyself draw up <!--
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>the covenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It will suffice me
that it be as Rhiannon said,&rdquo; answered Pwyll.&nbsp; So unto
that covenant were the sureties pledged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,
Lord,&rdquo; said Gwawl, &ldquo;I am greatly hurt, and I have
many bruises.&nbsp; I have need to be anointed, with thy leave I
will go forth.&nbsp; I will leave nobles in my stead, to answer
for me in all that thou shall require.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;mayest thou do
thus.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Gwawl went towards his own possessions.</p>
<p>And the hall was set in order for Pwyll and the men of his
host, and for them also of the palace, and they went to the
tables and sat down.&nbsp; And as they had sat that time
twelvemonth, so sat they that night.&nbsp; And they eat, and
feasted, and spent the night in mirth and tranquillity.&nbsp; And
the time came that they should sleep, and Pwyll and Rhiannon went
to their chamber.</p>
<p>And next morning at the break of day, &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo;
said Rhiannon, &ldquo;arise and begin to give thy gifts unto the
minstrels.&nbsp; Refuse no one to-day that may claim thy
bounty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus shall it be gladly,&rdquo; said
Pwyll, &ldquo;both to-day and every day while the feast shall
last.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Pwyll arose, and he caused silence to be
proclaimed, and desired all the suitors and the minstrels to show
and to point out what gifts were to their wish and desire. <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; And this being done the feast
went on, and he denied no one while it lasted.&nbsp; And when the
feast was ended, Pwyll said unto Heveydd, &ldquo;My Lord, with
thy permission I will set out for Dyved to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Heveydd,
&ldquo;may Heaven prosper thee.&nbsp; Fix also a time when
Rhiannon may follow thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By Heaven,&rdquo;
said Pwyll, &ldquo;we will go hence together.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wiliest thou this, Lord?&rdquo; said Heveydd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, by Heaven,&rdquo; answered Pwyll.</p>
<p>And the next day, they set forward towards Dyved, and
journeyed to the palace of Narberth, where a feast was made ready
for them.&nbsp; And there came to them great numbers of the chief
men and the most noble ladies of the land, and of these there
were none to whom Rhiannon did not give some rich gift, either a
bracelet, or a ring, or a precious stone.&nbsp; And they ruled
the land prosperously both that year and the next.</p>
<p>And in the third year the nobles of the land began to be
sorrowful at seeing a man whom they loved so much, and who was
moreover their lord and their foster-brother, without an
heir.&nbsp; And they came to him. <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp; And the place
where they met was Preseleu, in Dyved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;we know that thou art not so young as some of
the men of this country, and we fear that thou mayest not have an
heir of the wife whom thou hast taken.&nbsp; Take therefore
another wife of whom thou mayest have heirs.&nbsp; Thou canst not
always continue with us, and though thou desire to remain as thou
art, we will not suffer thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
said Pwyll, &ldquo;we have not long been joined together, and
many things may yet befall.&nbsp; Grant me a year from this time,
and for the space of a year we will abide together, and after
that I will do according to your wishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they
granted it.&nbsp; And before the end of a year a son was born
unto him.&nbsp; And in Narberth was he born; and on the night
that he was <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>born, women were brought to watch the
mother and the boy.&nbsp; And the women slept, as did also
Rhiannon, the mother of the boy.&nbsp; And the number of the
women that were brought into the chamber, was six.&nbsp; And they
watched for a good portion of the night, and before midnight
every one of them fell asleep, and towards break of day they
awoke; and when they awoke, they looked where they had put the
boy, and behold he was not there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said
one of the women, &ldquo;the boy is lost!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and it will be small
vengeance if we are burnt or put to death because of the
child.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said one of the women, &ldquo;Is there any
counsel for us in the world in this matter?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; answered another, &ldquo;I offer you good
counsel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is here a stag-hound bitch, and she has
a litter of whelps.&nbsp; Let us kill some of the cubs, and rub
the blood on the face and hands of Rhiannon, and lay the bones
before her, and assert that she herself had devoured her son, and
she alone will not be able to gainsay us six.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
according to this counsel it wast settled.&nbsp; And towards
morning Rhiannon awoke, and she said, &ldquo;Women, where is my
son?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;ask us
not concerning thy son, we have nought but the blows and the
bruises we got by struggling with thee, and of a truth we never
saw any woman so violent as thou, for it was of no avail to
contend with thee.&nbsp; Hast thou not thyself devoured thy
son?&nbsp; Claim him not therefore of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Rhiannon; &ldquo;The Lord God
knows all things.&nbsp; Charge me not falsely. <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; If you tell me this from <!--
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>fear, I assert before Heaven that I will defend
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;we would
not bring evil on ourselves for any one in the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said
Rhiannon; &ldquo;you will receive no evil by telling the
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; But for all her words, whether fair or harsh,
<a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a> she received but the same answer from
the women.</p>
<p>And Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn arose, and his household, and
his hosts.&nbsp; And this occurrence could not be concealed, but
the story went forth throughout the land, and all the nobles
heard it.&nbsp; Then the nobles came to Pwyll, and besought him
to put away his wife, because of the great <a
name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a> crime which she had done.&nbsp; But
Pwyll answered them, that they had no cause wherefore they might
ask him to put away his wife, save for her having no
children.&nbsp; &ldquo;But children has she now had, therefore
will I not put her away, if she has done wrong, let her do
penance for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Rhiannon sent for the teachers and the wise men, and as she
preferred doing penance to contending with the women, she took
upon her a penance.&nbsp; And the penance that was imposed upon
her was, that she should remain in that palace of Narberth until
the end of seven years, and that she should sit every day near
unto a horse-block that was without the gate.&nbsp; And that she
should relate the story to all who should come there, whom she
might suppose not to know it already; and that she should offer
the guests and strangers, if they would permit her, to carry them
upon her back into the palace.&nbsp; But it rarely happened that
any would permit.&nbsp; And thus did she spend part of the
year.</p>
<p>Now at that time Teirnyon Twryv Vliant was Lord <!-- page
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of
Gwent Is Coed, and he was the best man in the world.&nbsp; And
unto his house there belonged a mare, than which neither mare nor
horse in the kingdom was more beautiful.&nbsp; And on the night
of every first of May she foaled, and no one ever knew what
became of the colt.&nbsp; And one night Teirnyon talked with his
wife; &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is very simple of us
that our mare should foal every year, and that we should have
none of her colts.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What can be done in the
matter?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the night of the
first of May,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;The vengeance of
Heaven be upon me, if I learn not what it is that takes away the
colts.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he caused the mare to be brought into a
house, and he armed himself, and began to watch that night.&nbsp;
And in the beginning of the night, the mare foaled a large and
beautiful colt.&nbsp; And it was standing up in the place.&nbsp;
And Teirnyon rose up and looked at the size of the colt, and as
he did so he heard a great tumult, and after the tumult behold a
claw came through the window into the house, and it seized the
colt by the mane.&nbsp; Then Teirnyon drew his sword, and struck
off the arm at the elbow, so that portion of the arm together
with the colt was in the house with him.&nbsp; And then did he
hear a tumult and wailing, both at once.&nbsp; And he opened the
door, and rushed out in the direction of the noise, and he could
not see the cause of the tumult, because of the darkness of the
night; but he rushed after it and followed it.&nbsp; Then he
remembered that he had left the door open, and he returned.&nbsp;
And at the door behold there was an infant boy in swaddling
clothes, wrapped around in a mantle of satin.&nbsp; And he took
up the boy, and behold he was very strong for the age that he was
of.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Then he shut the door, and went unto the chamber where
his wife was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;art thou
sleeping?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I
was asleep, but as thou camest in I did awake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold here is a boy for thee if thou wilt,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;since thou hast never had one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My
Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;What adventure is
this?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was thus,&rdquo; said Teirnyon; and
he told her how it all befell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, Lord,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;What sort of garments are there upon the
boy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A mantle of satin,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is then a boy of gentle lineage,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if thou
wilt, I shall have great diversion and mirth.&nbsp; I will call
my women unto me, and tell them that I have been
pregnant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will readily grant thee to do
this,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; And thus did they, and they
caused the boy to be baptized, and the ceremony was performed
there; <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a> and the name which they gave unto him,
was Gwri Wallt Euryn, because what hair was upon his head was as
yellow as gold.&nbsp; And they had the boy nursed in the court
until he was a year old.&nbsp; And before the year was over, he
could walk stoutly.&nbsp; And he was larger than a boy of three
years old, even one of great growth and size.&nbsp; And the boy
was nursed the second year, and then he was as large as a child
six years old.&nbsp; And before the end of the fourth year, he
would bribe the grooms to allow him to take the horses to
water.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said his wife unto Teirnyon,
&ldquo;Where is the colt which thou didst save on the night that
thou foundest the boy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have commanded the
grooms of the horses,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that they take care
of him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Would it not be well, Lord,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;if thou wert to cause him to be broken in, and
given to <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the boy, seeing that on the same
night that thou didst find the boy, the colt was foaled and thou
didst save him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not oppose thee in
this matter,&rdquo; said Teirnyon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will allow thee
to give him the colt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;may Heaven reward thee; I will give it him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So the horse was given to the boy.&nbsp; Then she went to the
grooms and those who tended the horses, and commanded them to be
careful of the horse, so that he might be broken in by the time
that the boy could ride him.</p>
<p>And while these things were going forward, they heard tidings
of Rhiannon and her punishment.&nbsp; And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant,
by reason of the pity that he felt on hearing this story of
Rhiannon, and her punishment, enquired closely concerning it,
until he had heard from many of those who came to his
court.&nbsp; Then did Teirnyon, often lamenting the sad history,
ponder within himself, and he looked steadfastly on the boy, and
as he looked upon him, it seemed to him that he had never beheld
so great a likeness between father and son, as between the boy
and Pwyll, the chief of Annwvyn.&nbsp; Now the semblance of Pwyll
was well known to him, for he had of yore been one of his
followers.&nbsp; And thereupon he became grieved for the wrong
that he did, in keeping with him a boy whom he knew to be the son
of another man.&nbsp; And the first time that he was alone with
his wife, he told her, that it was not right that they should
keep the boy with them, and suffer so excellent a lady as
Rhiannon to be punished so greatly on his account, whereas the
boy was the son of Pwyll, the chief of Annwvyn.&nbsp; And
Teirnyon&rsquo;s wife agreed with him, that they should send the
boy to Pwyll.&nbsp; &ldquo;And three things, Lord,&rdquo; said
she, <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;shall we gain thereby.&nbsp; Thanks and gifts for
releasing Rhiannon from her punishment; and thanks from Pwyll,
for nursing his son, and restoring him unto him; and thirdly, if
the boy is of gentle nature, he will be our foster-son, and he
will do for us all the good in his power.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it was
settled according to this counsel.</p>
<p>And no later than the next day was Teirnyon equipped, and two
other knights with him.&nbsp; And the boy, as a fourth in their
company, went with them upon the horse which Teirnyon had given
him.&nbsp; And they journeyed towards Narberth, and it was not
long before they reached that place.&nbsp; And as they drew near
to the palace, they beheld Rhiannon sitting beside the horse
block.&nbsp; And when they were opposite to her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Chieftain,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;go not further thus, I
will bear every one of you into the palace, and this is my
penance for slaying my own son and devouring
him.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh fair lady,&rdquo; said
Teirnyon, &ldquo;think not that I will be one to be carried upon
thy back.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither will I,&rdquo; said the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly, my soul,&rdquo; said Teirnyon, &ldquo;we
will not go.&rdquo; <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; So they went
forward to the palace, and there was great joy at their
coming.&nbsp; And at the palace a feast was prepared, because
Pwyll was come back from the confines of Dyved.&nbsp; And they
went into the hall and washed, and Pwyll rejoiced to see
Teirnyon.&nbsp; And in this order they sat.&nbsp; Teirnyon
between Pwyll and Rhiannon, and Teirnyon&rsquo;s two companions
on the other side of Pwyll, with the boy between them.&nbsp; <!--
page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>And after meat they began to carouse and to
discourse.&nbsp; And Teirnyon&rsquo;s discourse was concerning
the adventure of the mare and the boy, and how he and his wife
had nursed and reared the child as their own.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
behold here is thy son, lady,&rdquo; said Teirnyon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And whosoever told that lie concerning thee, has done
wrong.&nbsp; And when I heard of thy sorrow, I was troubled and
grieved.&nbsp; And I believe that there is none of this host, who
will not perceive that the boy is the son of Pwyll,&rdquo; said
Teirnyon.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; said they all,
&ldquo;who is not certain thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare
to Heaven,&rdquo; said Rhiannon, &ldquo;that if this be true,
there indeed is an end to my trouble.&rdquo; <a
name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said
Pendaran Dyved, &ldquo;well hast thou named thy son Pryderi, and
well becomes him the name of Pryderi, son of Pwyll, chief of
Annwvyn.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; said Rhiannon,
&ldquo;will not his own name become him better?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What name has he?&rdquo; asked Pendaran Dyved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gwri Wallt Euryn, is the name that we gave
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pryderi,&rdquo; said Pendaran,
&ldquo;shall his name be.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It were more
proper,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;that the boy should take his
name from the word his mother spoke when she received the joyful
tidings of him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus was it arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teirnyon,&rdquo; said Pwyll, &ldquo;Heaven reward thee
that thou hast reared the boy up to this time, and, being of
gentle lineage, <a name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a> it were fitting that he repay thee for
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said Teirnyon, &ldquo;It
was my wife who nursed him, and there is no one in the world so
afflicted as she at parting with him.&nbsp; It were well that he
should bear in mind what I and my wife <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>have done for
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I call Heaven to witness,&rdquo; said
Pwyll, &ldquo;that while I live I will support thee and thy
possessions, as long as I am able to preserve my own.&nbsp; And
when he shall have power, he will more fitly maintain them than
I. <a name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; And if this counsel be pleasing
unto thee, and to my nobles, it shall be that, as thou hast
reared him up to the present time, I will give him to be brought
up by Pendaran Dyved, from henceforth.&nbsp; And you shall be
companions and shall both be foster-fathers unto
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is good counsel,&rdquo; said they
all.&nbsp; So the boy was given to Pendaran Dyved, and the nobles
of the land were sent with him.&nbsp; And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant,
and his companions, set out for his country, and his possessions,
with love and gladness.&nbsp; And he went not without being
offered the fairest jewels and the fairest horses and the
choicest dogs; but he would take none of them.</p>
<p>Thereupon they all remained in their own dominions.&nbsp; And
Pryderi, the son of Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn, was brought up
carefully as was fit, so that he became the fairest youth, and
the most comely, and the best skilled in all good games, of any
in the kingdom.&nbsp; And thus passed years and years, until the
end of Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn&rsquo;s life came, and he
died.</p>
<p>And Pryderi ruled the seven Cantrevs of Dyved prosperously,
and he was beloved by his people, and by all around him.&nbsp;
And at length <a name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b"
class="citation">[37b]</a> he added unto them the three Cantrevs
of Ystrad Tywi and the four Cantrevs of Cardigan; and these were
called <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the Seven Cantrevs of
Seissyllwch.&nbsp; And when he made this addition, Pryderi the
son of Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn, desired to take a wife.&nbsp;
And the wife he chose was Kicva, the daughter of Gwynn Gohoyw,
the son of Gloyw Wlallt <a name="citation38"></a><a

Island, and he was exalted from the crown of London. <a
name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a>&nbsp; And one afternoon he was at
Harlech in Ardudwy, at his court, and he sat upon the rock of
Harlech, looking over the sea. <a name="citation39b"></a><a
href="#footnote39b" class="citation">[39b]</a>&nbsp; And with him
were his brother Manawyddan the son of Llyr, <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>and his
brothers by the mother&rsquo;s side, Nissyen and Evnissyen, and
many nobles likewise, as was fitting to see around a king.&nbsp;
His two brothers by the mother&rsquo;s side were the sons of
Eurosswydd, by his mother, Penardun, <a name="citation40"></a><a
href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a> the daughter of Beli
son of Manogan.&nbsp; And one of these youths was a good youth
and of gentle nature, and would make peace between his kindred
and cause his family to be friends when their wrath was at the
highest; and this one was Nissyen; but the other would cause
strife between his two brothers when they were most at
peace.&nbsp; And as they sat thus, they beheld thirteen ships
coming from the South of Ireland, and making towards them, and
they came with a swift motion, the wind being behind them, and
they neared them rapidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see ships afar,&rdquo;
said the king, &ldquo;coming swiftly towards the land.&nbsp;
Command the men of the court that they equip themselves, and go
and learn their intent.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the men equipped
themselves and went down towards them.&nbsp; And when they saw
the ships near, certain were they that they had never seen ships
better furnished.&nbsp; Beautiful flags of satin were upon
them.&nbsp; And behold one of the ships outstripped the others,
and they saw a shield lifted up above the side of the ship, and
the point of the shield was upwards, in token of peace.&nbsp; And
the men drew near that they might hold converse.&nbsp; Then they
put out boats and came towards the land.&nbsp; And they saluted
the king.&nbsp; Now the king could hear them from the place where
he was, upon the rock above their heads.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven
prosper you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and be ye welcome.&nbsp; To
whom do these ships belong and who is the chief amongst
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>they,
&ldquo;Matholwch king of Ireland is here and these ships belong
to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore comes he?&rdquo; asked the
king, &ldquo;and will he come to the land?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He
is a suitor unto thee, lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;and he will
not land unless he have his boon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
may that be?&rdquo; enquired the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;He desires to
ally himself with thee, lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;and he
comes to ask Branwen the daughter of Llyr, that, if it seem well
to thee, the Island of the Mighty may be leagued with Ireland and
both become more powerful.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;let him come to land, and we will take counsel
thereupon.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this answer was brought to
Matholwch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go willingly,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; So he landed, and they received him joyfully; and great
was the throng in the palace that night, between his hosts and
those of the court; and next day they took counsel, and they
resolved to bestow Branwen upon Matholwch.&nbsp; Now she was one
of the three chief ladies of this Island, and she was the fairest
damsel in the world.</p>
<p>And they fixed upon Aberffraw, as the place where she should
become his bride.&nbsp; And they went thence, and towards
Aberffraw the hosts proceeded; Matholwch and his host in their
ships; Bendigeid Vran and his host by land, until they came to
Aberffraw.&nbsp; And at Aberffraw they began the feast and sat
down.&nbsp; And thus sat they.&nbsp; The King of the Island of
the Mighty and Manawyddan the son of Llyr, on one side, and
Matholwch on the other side, and Branwen the daughter of Llyr
beside him.&nbsp; And they were not within a house, but under
tents.&nbsp; No house could ever contain Bendigeid Vran.&nbsp;
And they began the banquet and caroused and discoursed.&nbsp; And
when it was more pleasing to them to sleep than <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>to carouse
they went to rest, and that night Branwen became
Matholwch&rsquo;s bride.</p>
<p>And next day they arose, and all they of the court, and the
officers began to equip and to range the horses and the
attendants, and they ranged them in order as far as the sea.</p>
<p>And behold one day, Evnissyen, the quarrelsome man of whom it
is spoken above, came by chance into the place, where the horses
of Matholwch were, and asked whose horses they might be.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are the horses of Matholwch king of Ireland, who is
married to Branwen, thy sister; his horses are they.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And is it thus they have done with a maiden such as she,
and moreover my sister, bestowing her without my consent?&nbsp;
They could have offered no greater insult to me than this,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; And thereupon he rushed under the horses and cut
off their lips at the teeth, and their ears close to their heads,
and their tails <a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a> close to their backs, and wherever he
could clutch their eyelids, he cut them to the very bone, and he
disfigured the horses and rendered them useless.</p>
<p>And they came with these tidings unto Matholwch, saying that
the horses were disfigured, and injured so that not one of them
could ever be of any use again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, lord,&rdquo;
said one, &ldquo;it was an insult unto thee, and as such was it
meant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a truth, it is a marvel to me, that
if they desire to insult me, they should have given me a maiden
of such high rank and so much beloved of her kindred, as they
have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said another,
&ldquo;thou seest that thus it is, and there is nothing for thee
to do but to <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>go to thy ships.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
thereupon towards his ships he set out.</p>
<p>And tidings came to Bendigeid Vran that Matholwch was quitting
the court without asking leave, and messengers were sent to
enquire of him wherefore he did so.&nbsp; And the messengers that
went, were Iddic the son of Anarawd, and Heveydd Hir.&nbsp; And
these overtook him and asked of him what he designed to do, and
wherefore he went forth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;if I had known I had not come hither.&nbsp; I have been
altogether insulted, no one had ever worse treatment than I have
had here.&nbsp; But one thing surprises me above
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked they.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That Branwen the daughter of Llyr, one of the three chief
ladies of this Island, and the daughter of the King of the Island
of the Mighty, should have been given me as my bride, and that
after that I should have been insulted; and I marvel that the
insult was not done me before they had bestowed upon me a maiden
so exalted as she.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly, lord, it was not
the will of any that are of the court,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;nor of any that are of the council that thou shouldest
have received this insult, and as thou hast been insulted, the
dishonour is greater unto Bendigeid Vran than unto
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think
so.&nbsp; Nevertheless he cannot recall the insult.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These men returned with that answer to the place where Bendigeid
Vran was, and they told him what reply Matholwch had given
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are no
means by which we may prevent his going away at enmity with us,
that we will not take.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, lord,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;send after him another embassy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Arise
Manawyddan son of Llyr, and Heveydd Hir, and <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Unic Glew
Ysgwyd, and go after him, and tell him that he shall have a sound
horse for every one that has been injured.&nbsp; And beside that,
as an atonement for the insult, he shall have a staff of silver,
as large and as tall as himself, and a plate of gold of the
breadth of his face.&nbsp; And show unto him who it was that did
this, and that it was done against my will; but that he who did
it is my brother, by the mother&rsquo;s side, and therefore it
would be hard for me to put him to death.&nbsp; And let him come
and meet me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we will make peace in any
way he may desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The embassy went after Matholwch, and told him all these
sayings in a friendly manner, and he listened thereunto.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will take
counsel.&rdquo;&nbsp; So to the council he went.&nbsp; And in the
council they considered that if they should refuse this, they
were likely to have more shame rather than to obtain so great an
atonement.&nbsp; They resolved therefore to accept it, and they
returned to the court in peace.</p>
<p>Then the pavilions and the tents were set in order after the
fashion of a hall; and they went to meat, and as they had sat at
the beginning of the feast, so sat they there.&nbsp; And
Matholwch and Bendigeid Vran began to discourse; and behold it
seemed to Bendigeid Vran, while they talked, that Matholwch was
not so cheerful as he had been before.&nbsp; And he thought that
the chieftain might be sad because of the smallness of the
atonement which he had, for the wrong that had been done
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh man,&rdquo; said Bendigeid Vran, &ldquo;thou
dost not discourse to-night so cheerfully as thou wert
wont.&nbsp; And if it be because of the smallness of the
atonement, thou shalt add <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>thereunto
whatsoever thou mayest choose, and to-morrow I will pay thee the
horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Heaven
reward thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And I will enhance the
atonement,&rdquo; said Bendigeid Vran, &ldquo;for I will give
unto thee a cauldron, the property of which is, that if one of
thy men be slain to-day, and be cast therein, to-morrow he will
be as well as ever he was at the best, except that he will not
regain his speech.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he gave him great
thanks, and very joyful was he for that cause.</p>
<p>And the next morning they paid Matholwch the horses as long as
the trained horses lasted.&nbsp; And then they journeyed into
another commot, where they paid him with colts until the whole
had been paid, and from thenceforth that commot was called
Talebolion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p46.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p46.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And a second night sat they together.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
lord,&rdquo; said Matholwch, &ldquo;whence hadst thou the
cauldron which thou hast given me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I had it
of a man who had been in thy land,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I
would not give it except to one from there.&rdquo; <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; asked
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Llassar Llaesgyvnewid; he came here from
Ireland, with Kymideu Kymeinvoll, his wife, who escaped from the
Iron House in Ireland, when it was made red hot around them, and
fled hither.&nbsp; And it is a marvel to me that thou shouldst
know nothing concerning the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Something
I do know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and as much as I know I will
tell thee.&nbsp; One day I was hunting in Ireland, and I came to
the mound at the head of the lake, which is called the Lake of
the Cauldron.&nbsp; And I beheld a huge yellow-haired man coming
from the lake with a cauldron upon his back.&nbsp; And he was a
man of vast <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>size, and of horrid aspect, and a
woman followed after him.&nbsp; And if the man was tall, twice as
large as he was the woman, and they came towards me and greeted
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Verily,&rsquo; asked I, &lsquo;wherefore are you
journeying?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Behold this,&rsquo; said he to
me, &lsquo;is the cause that we journey.&nbsp; At the end of a
month and a fortnight this woman will have a son; and the child
that will be born at the end of the month and the fortnight will
be a warrior fully armed.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I took them with me,
and maintained them.&nbsp; And they were with me for a
year.&nbsp; And that year I had them with me not
grudgingly.&nbsp; But thenceforth was there murmuring, because
that they were with me.&nbsp; For from the beginning of the
fourth month they had <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>begun to make themselves hated and to
be disorderly in the land; committing outrages, and molesting and
harassing the nobles and ladies; and thenceforward my people rose
up and besought me to part with them, and they bade me to choose
between them and my dominions.&nbsp; And I applied to the council
of my country to know what should be done concerning them; for of
their own free will they would not go, neither could they be
compelled against their will, through fighting.&nbsp; And [the
people of the country,] being in this strait, they caused a
chamber to be made all of iron.&nbsp; Now when the chamber was
ready, there came there every smith that was in Ireland, and
every one who owned tongs and hammer.&nbsp; And they caused coals
to be piled up as high as the top of the chamber.&nbsp; And they
had the man, and the woman, and the children, served with plenty
of meat and drink; but when it was known that they were drunk,
they began to put fire to the coals about the chamber, and they
blew it with bellows until the house was red hot all around
them.&nbsp; Then was there a council held in the centre of the
floor of the chamber.&nbsp; And the man tarried until the plates
of iron were all of a white heat; and then, by reason of the
great heat, the man dashed against the plates with his shoulder
and struck them out, and his wife followed him; but except him
and his wife none escaped thence.&nbsp; And then I suppose,
lord,&rdquo; said Matholwch unto Bendigeid Vran, &ldquo;that he
came over unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubtless he came
here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and gave unto me the
cauldron.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In what manner didst thou receive
them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I dispersed them through every part of
my dominions, and they have become numerous and are prospering
everywhere, and they fortify the places <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>where they
are with men and arms, of the best that were ever
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night they continued to discourse as much as they would,
and had minstrelsy and carousing, and when it was more pleasant
to them to sleep than to sit longer, they went to rest.&nbsp; And
thus was the banquet carried on with joyousness; and when it was
finished, Matholwch journeyed towards Ireland, and Branwen with
him, and they went from Aber Menei, with thirteen ships and came
to Ireland.&nbsp; And in Ireland was there great joy because of
their coming.&nbsp; And not one great man or noble lady visited
Branwen unto whom she gave not either a clasp, or a ring, or a
royal jewel to keep, such as it was honourable to be seen
departing with.&nbsp; And in these things she spent that year in
much renown, and she passed her time pleasant, enjoying honour
and friendship.&nbsp; And in the meanwhile, it chanced that she
became pregnant, and in due time a son was born unto her, and the
name that they gave him was Gwern the son of Matholwch, and they
put the boy out to be foster-nursed, in a place where were the
best men of Ireland.</p>
<p>And behold in the second year a tumult arose in Ireland, on
account of the insult which Matholwch had received in Wales, and
the payment made him for his horses.&nbsp; And his
foster-brothers, and such as were nearest unto him, blamed him
openly <a name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a> for that matter.&nbsp; And he might
have no peace by reason of the tumult until they should revenge
upon him this disgrace.&nbsp; And the vengeance which they took
was to drive away Branwen from the same chamber with him, and to
make her cook <a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a> for the court; and they <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>caused the butcher, after he had cut up the meat, to
come to her and give her every day a blow on the ear, and such
they made her punishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, lord,&rdquo; said his men to Matholwch,
&ldquo;forbid now the ships and the ferry boats and the coracles,
that they go not into Wales, and such as come over from Wales
hither, imprison them that they go not back for this thing to be
known there.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they did so; and it was thus for no
less than three years.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p49.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p49.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And Branwen reared a starling in the cover of the kneading
trough, and she taught it to speak, and she taught the bird what
manner of man her brother was.&nbsp; And she wrote a letter of
her woes, and the despite with which she was treated, and she
bound the letter to the root of the bird&rsquo;s wing, and sent
it towards Wales.&nbsp; And the bird came to this Island, and one
day it found Bendigeid Vran at Caer Seiont in Arvon, conferring
there, and it alighted upon his shoulder and ruffled its
feathers, so that the <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>letter was seen, and they knew that
the bird had been reared in a domestic manner.</p>
<p>Then Bendigeid Vran took the letter and looked upon it.&nbsp;
And when he had read the letter, he grieved exceedingly at the
tidings of Branwen&rsquo;s woes.&nbsp; And immediately he began
sending messengers to summon the Island together.&nbsp; And he
caused seven score and four countries to come unto him, and he
complained to them himself of the grief that his sister
endured.&nbsp; So they took counsel.&nbsp; And in the counsel
they resolved to go to Ireland, and to leave seven men as princes
here.&nbsp; And Caradawc the son of Bran, as the chief of them,
and their seven knights.&nbsp; In Edeyrnion, were these men
left.&nbsp; And for this reason were the seven knights placed in
the town. <a name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a>&nbsp; Now the names of these seven
were Caradawc the son of Bran, and Heveydd Hir, and Unic Glew
Ysgwyd, and Iddic the son of Anarawc Gwalltgrwn, and Fodor the
son of Ervyll, and Gwlch Minascwrn, and Llassar the son of
Llaesar Llaesgygwyd, and Pendaran Dyved as a young page with
them.&nbsp; And these abode as seven ministers to take charge of
this Island; and Caradawc the son of Bran was the chief amongst
them.</p>
<p>Bendigeid Vran, with the hosts of which we spoke, sailed
towards Ireland, and it was not far across the sea, and he came
to shoal water.&nbsp; It was but by two rivers; the Lli and the
Archan were they called; and the nations covered the sea. <a
name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a>&nbsp; Then he proceeded with what
provisions he had on his own back, and approached the shore of
Ireland.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Now the swineherds of Matholwch were upon the sea shore,
and they came to Matholwch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;greeting be unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven protect
you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have you any news?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;we have marvellous news; a
wood have we seen upon the sea, in a place where we never yet saw
a single tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is indeed a
marvel,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;saw you aught else?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We saw, lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;a vast mountain
beside the wood, which moved, and there was a lofty ridge on the
top of the mountain, and a lake on each side of the ridge.&nbsp;
And the wood, and the mountain, and all these things
moved.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there
is none who can know aught concerning this, unless it be
Branwen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Messengers then went unto Branwen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;What thinkest thou that this is?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The men of the Island of the Mighty, who have come hither
on hearing of my ill treatment and my woes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the forest that is seen upon the sea?&rdquo; asked
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;The yards and the masts of ships,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;what is the
mountain that is seen by the side of the ships?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bendigeid Vran, my brother,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;coming to shoal water; there is no ship that can contain
him in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the lofty ridge with the
lake on each side thereof?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;On looking towards
this Island he is wroth, and his two eyes on each side of his
nose are the two lakes on each side of the ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warriors and chief men of Ireland were brought together in
haste, and they took counsel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said the
nobles unto Matholwch, &ldquo;there is no other counsel than to
retreat over the Linon, <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>(a river which is <a
name="citation52a"></a><a href="#footnote52a"
class="citation">[52a]</a> in Ireland,) and to keep the river
between thee and him, and to break down the bridge that is across
the river, for there is a load-stone at the bottom of the river
that neither ship nor vessel can pass over.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they
retreated across the river, and broke down the bridge.</p>
<p>Bendigeid Vran came to land, and the fleet with him by the
bank of the river.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said his chieftains,
&ldquo;knowest thou the nature of this river, that nothing can go
across it, and there is no bridge over it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;is thy counsel concerning a
bridge?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;except that he who will be chief let him be a
bridge.&nbsp; I will be so,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And then was
that saying first uttered, and it is still used as a
proverb.&nbsp; And when he had lain down across the river,
hurdles were placed upon him, and the host passed over
thereby.</p>
<p>And as he rose up, behold the messengers of Matholwch came to
him, and saluted him, and gave him greeting in the name of
Matholwch, his kinsman, and showed how that of his good will he
had merited of him nothing but good.&nbsp; &ldquo;For Matholwch
has given the kingdom of Ireland to Gwern the son of Matholwch,
thy nephew and thy sister&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; And this he places
before thee, as a compensation for the wrong and despite that has
been done unto Branwen.&nbsp; And Matholwch shall be maintained
wheresoever thou wilt, either here or in the Island of the
Mighty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Bendigeid Vran, &ldquo;Shall not I
myself have the kingdom? <a name="citation52b"></a><a
href="#footnote52b" class="citation">[52b]</a>&nbsp; Then
peradventure I may take counsel <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>concerning
your message.&nbsp; From this time until then no other answer
will you get from me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said
they, &ldquo;the best message that we receive for thee, we will
convey it unto thee, and do thou await our message unto
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will wait,&rdquo; answered he,
&ldquo;and do you return quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messengers set forth and came to Matholwch.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;prepare a better message
for Bendigeid Vran.&nbsp; He would not listen at all to the
message that we bore him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo;
said Matholwch, &ldquo;what may be your counsel?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;there is no other counsel
than this alone.&nbsp; He was never known to be within a house,
make therefore a house that will contain him and the men of the
Island of the Mighty on the one side, and thyself and thy host on
the other; and give over thy kingdom to his will, and do him
homage.&nbsp; So by reason of the honour thou doest him in making
him a house, whereas he never before had a house to contain him,
he will make peace with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the messengers went
back to Bendigeid Vran, bearing him this message.</p>
<p>And he took counsel, and in the council it was resolved that
he should accept this, and this was all done by the advice of
Branwen, and lest the country should be destroyed.&nbsp; And this
peace was made, and the house was built both vast and
strong.&nbsp; But the Irish planned a crafty device, and the
craft was that they should put brackets on each side of the
hundred pillars that were in the house, and should place a
leathern bag on each bracket, and an armed man in every one of
them.&nbsp; Then Evnissyen came in before the host of the Island
of the Mighty, and scanned the house with fierce and savage
looks, and <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>descried the leathern bags which were
around the pillars.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is in this bag?&rdquo;
asked he of one of the Irish.&nbsp; &ldquo;Meal, good
soul,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And Evnissyen felt about it until he
came to the man&rsquo;s head, and he squeezed the head until he
felt his fingers meet together in the brain through the
bone.&nbsp; And he left that one and put his hand upon another,
and asked what was therein?&nbsp; &ldquo;Meal,&rdquo; said the
Irishman.&nbsp; So he did the like unto every one of them, until
he had not left alive of all the two hundred men save one only;
and when he came to him, he asked what was there?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Meal, good soul,&rdquo; said the Irishman.&nbsp; And he
felt about until he felt the head, and he squeezed that head as
he had done the others.&nbsp; And albeit he found that the head
of this one was armed, he left him not until he had killed
him.&nbsp; And then he sang an Englyn,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is in this bag a different sort of
meal,<br />
The ready combatant, when the assault is made<br />
By his fellow warriors, prepared for battle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon came the hosts unto the house.&nbsp; The men of the
Island of Ireland entered the house on the one side, and the men
of the Island of the Mighty on the other.&nbsp; And as soon as
they had sat down, there was concord between them; and the
sovereignty was conferred upon the boy.&nbsp; When the peace was
concluded, Bendigeid Vran called the boy unto him, and from
Bendigeid Vran the boy went unto Manawyddan, and he was beloved
by all that beheld him.&nbsp; And from Manawyddan the boy was
called by Nissyen the son of Eurosswydd, and the boy went unto
him lovingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore,&rdquo; said Evnissyen,
&ldquo;comes not my nephew the son of my <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>sister unto
me?&nbsp; Though he were not king of Ireland, yet willingly would
I fondle the boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cheerfully let him go to
thee,&rdquo; said Bendigeid Vran, and the boy went unto him
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;By my confession to Heaven,&rdquo; said
Evnissyen in his heart, &ldquo;unthought of by the household is
the slaughter that I will this instant commit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he arose and took up the boy by the feet, and before any
one in the house could seize hold of him, he thrust the boy
headlong into the blazing fire.&nbsp; And when Branwen saw her
son burning in the fire, she strove to leap into the fire also,
from the place where she sat between her two brothers.&nbsp; But
Bendigeid Vran grasped her with one hand, and his shield with the
other.&nbsp; Then they all hurried about the house, and never was
there made so great a tumult by any host in one house as was made
by them, as each man armed himself.&nbsp; Then said
Morddwydtyllyon, &ldquo;The gad-flies of Morddwydtyllyon&rsquo;s
Cow!&rdquo;&nbsp; And while they all sought their arms, Bendigeid
Vran supported Branwen between his shield and his shoulder.</p>
<p>Then the Irish kindled a fire under the cauldron of
renovation, and they cast the dead bodies into the cauldron until
it was full, and the next day they came forth fighting men as
good as before, except that they were not able to speak.&nbsp;
Then when Evnissyen saw the dead bodies of the men of the Island
of the Mighty nowhere resuscitated, he said in his heart,
&ldquo;Alas! woe is me, that I should have been the cause of
bringing the men of the Island of the Mighty into so great a
strait.&nbsp; Evil betide me if I find not a deliverance
therefrom.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he cast himself among the dead bodies
of the Irish, and <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>two unshod Irishmen came to him, and,
taking him to be one of the Irish, flung him into the
cauldron.&nbsp; And he stretched himself out in the cauldron, so
that he rent the cauldron into four pieces, and burst his own
heart also.</p>
<p>In consequence of that, the men of the Island of the Mighty
obtained such success as they had; but they were not victorious,
for only seven men of them all escaped, and Bendigeid Vran
himself was wounded in the foot with a poisoned dart.&nbsp; Now
the seven men that escaped were Pryderi, Manawyddan, Gluneu <a
name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a> Eil Taran, Taliesin, Ynawc, Grudyen <a
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"
class="citation">[56b]</a> the son of Muryel, and Heilyn the son
of Gwynn Hen.</p>
<p>And Bendigeid Vran commanded them that they should cut off his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;And take you my head,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and bear it even unto the White Mount, in London, and bury
it there, with the face towards France.&nbsp; And a long time
will you be upon the road.&nbsp; In Harlech you will be feasting
seven years, the birds of Rhiannon singing unto you the
while.&nbsp; And all that time the head will be to you as
pleasant company as it ever was when on my body.&nbsp; And at
Gwales in Penvro you will be fourscore years, and you may remain
there, and the head with you uncorrupted, until you open the door
that looks towards Aber Henvelen, and towards Cornwall.&nbsp; And
after you have opened that door, there you may no longer tarry,
set forth then to London to bury the head and go straight
forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they cut off his head, and these seven went forward
therewith.&nbsp; And Branwen was the eighth with them, and they
came to land at Aber Alaw, in Talebolyon, and they sat down to
rest.&nbsp; And <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Branwen looked towards Ireland and
towards the Island of the Mighty, to see if she could descry
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;woe is me that I
was ever born; two Islands have been destroyed because of
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she uttered a loud groan and there broke
her heart.&nbsp; And they made her a four-sided grave and buried
her upon the banks of the Alaw.</p>
<p>Then the seven men journeyed forward towards Harlech, bearing
the head with them; and as they went behold there met them a
multitude of men and of women.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you any
tidings?&rdquo; asked Manawyddan.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have
none,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;save that Caswallawn, the son of
Beli, has conquered the Island of the Mighty, and is crowned King
in London.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What has become,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;of Caradawc the son of Bran, and the seven men who were
left with him in this Island?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Caswallawn came
upon them, and slew six of the men, and Caradawc&rsquo;s heart
broke for grief thereof; for he could see the sword that slew the
men, but knew not who it was that wielded it.&nbsp; Caswallawn
had flung upon him the Veil of Illusion, so that no one could see
him slay the men, but the sword only could they see.&nbsp; And it
liked him not to slay Caradawc, because he was his nephew the son
of his cousin.&nbsp; And now he was the third whose heart had
broke through grief.&nbsp; Pendaran Dyved, who had remained as a
young page with these men, escaped into the wood,&rdquo; said
they.</p>
<p>Then they went on to Harlech, and there stopped to rest, and
they provided meat and liquor, and sat down to eat and to
drink.&nbsp; And there came three birds, and began singing unto
them a certain song, and all the songs they had ever heard were
unpleasant <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>compared thereto; and the birds
seemed to them to be at a great distance from them over the sea,
yet they appeared as distinct as if they were close by; and at
this repast they continued seven years.</p>
<p>And at the close of the seventh year, they went forth to
Gwales in Penvro.&nbsp; And there they found a fair and regal
spot overlooking the ocean; and a spacious hall was
therein.&nbsp; And they went into the hall, and two of its doors
were open, but the third door was closed, that which looked
towards Cornwall.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, yonder,&rdquo; said
Manawyddan, &ldquo;is the door that we may not open.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And that night they regaled themselves and were joyful.&nbsp; And
of all they had seen of food laid before them, and of all they
had heard of, they remembered nothing; neither of that, nor of
any sorrow whatsoever.&nbsp; And there they remained fourscore
years, unconscious of having ever spent a time more joyous and
mirthful.&nbsp; And they were not more weary than when first they
came, neither did they, any of them, know the time they had been
there.&nbsp; And it was not more irksome to them having the head
with them, than if Bendigeid Vran had been with them
himself.&nbsp; And because of these fourscore years, it was
called the entertaining of the noble head.&nbsp; The entertaining
of Branwen and Matholwch was in the time that they went to
Ireland.</p>
<p>One day said Heilyn the son of Gwynn, &ldquo;Evil betide me,
if I do not open the door to know if that is true which is said
concerning it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he opened the door and looked
towards Cornwall and Aber Henvelen.&nbsp; And when they had
looked, they were as conscious of all the evils they had ever
sustained, and of all the friends and companions they had lost,
<!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>and of all the misery that had befallen them, as if all
had happened in that very spot; <a name="citation59a"></a><a
href="#footnote59a" class="citation">[59a]</a> and especially of
the fate of their lord.&nbsp; And because of their perturbation
they could not rest, <a name="citation59b"></a><a
href="#footnote59b" class="citation">[59b]</a> but journeyed
forth with the head towards London.&nbsp; And they buried the
head in the White Mount, and when it was buried, this was the
third goodly concealment; and it was the third ill-fated
disclosure when it was disinterred, inasmuch as no invasion from
across the sea came to this Island, while the head was in that
concealment.</p>
<p>And thus is the story related of those who journeyed over from
Ireland.</p>
<p>In Ireland none were left alive, except five pregnant women in
a cave in the Irish wilderness; and to these five women in the
same night were born five sons, whom they nursed until they
became grown up youths.&nbsp; And they thought about wives, and
they at the same time desired to possess them, and each took a
wife of the mothers of their companions, and they governed the
country and peopled it.</p>
<p>And these five divided it amongst them, and because of this
partition are the five divisions of Ireland still so
termed.&nbsp; And they examined the land where the battles had
taken place, and they found gold and silver until they became
wealthy.</p>
<p>And thus ends this portion of the Mabinogi, concerning the
blow given to Branwen, which was the third unhappy blow of this
Island; and concerning the entertainment of Bran, when the hosts
of sevenscore countries and ten went over to Ireland, to <!--
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>revenge the blow given to Branwen; and concerning the
seven years&rsquo; banquet in Harlech, and the singing of the
birds of Rhiannon, and the sojourning of the head for the space
of fourscore years.</p>

</a></p>
<p>When the seven men of whom we spoke above, had buried the head
of Bendigeid Vran, in the White Mount in London, with its face
towards France, Manawyddan gazed upon the town of London, and
upon his companions, and heaved a great sigh, and much grief and
heaviness came upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas, Almighty Heaven, woe
is me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;there is none save myself
without a resting place this <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Pryderi,
&ldquo;be not so sorrowful.&nbsp; Thy cousin is king of the
Island of the Mighty, and though he should do thee wrong, thou
hast never been a claimant of land or possessions.&nbsp; Thou art
the third disinherited <a name="citation62a"></a><a
href="#footnote62a" class="citation">[62a]</a>
prince.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;but
although this man is my cousin, it grieveth me to see any one in
the place of my brother Bendigeid Vran, neither can I be happy in
the same dwelling with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou follow
the counsel of another?&rdquo; <a name="citation62b"></a><a
href="#footnote62b" class="citation">[62b]</a> said
Pryderi.&nbsp; &ldquo;I stand in need of counsel,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;and what may that counsel be?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Seven Cantrevs remain unto me,&rdquo; said Pryderi,
&ldquo;wherein Rhiannon my mother dwells, I will bestow her upon
thee and the seven Cantrevs with her, and though thou hadst no
possessions but those Cantrevs only, thou couldst not have seven
Cantrevs fairer than they.&nbsp; Kicva, the daughter of Gwynn
Gloyw, is my wife, and since the inheritance of the Cantrevs
belongs to me, do thou and Rhiannon enjoy them, and if thou ever
desire any possessions thou wilt take these.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not, chieftain,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;Heaven reward
thee for thy friendship.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I would show thee
the best friendship in the world if thou wouldst let
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, my friend,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and Heaven reward thee.&nbsp; I will go with thee to seek
Rhiannon and to look at thy possessions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
wilt do well,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I believe that
thou didst never hear a lady discourse better than she, and when
she was in her prime none was ever fairer.&nbsp; Even now her
aspect is not uncomely.&rdquo; <a name="citation62c"></a><a
href="#footnote62c" class="citation">[62c]</a>&nbsp; They set
forth, and, however long the journey, <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>they came at
length to Dyved, and a feast was prepared for them against their
coming to Narberth, which Rhiannon and Kicva had provided.&nbsp;
Then began Manawyddan and Rhiannon to sit and to talk together,
and from their discourse his mind and his thoughts became warmed
towards her, and he thought in his heart he had never beheld any
lady more fulfilled of grace and beauty than she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pryderi,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will that it be as thou
didst say.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What saying was that?&rdquo; asked
Rhiannon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Pryderi, &ldquo;I did
offer thee as a wife to Manawyddan the son of Llyr.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;By that will I gladly abide,&rdquo; said Rhiannon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Right glad am I also,&rdquo; said Manawyddan, &ldquo;May
Heaven reward him who hath shewn unto me friendship so perfect as
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before the feast was over she became his bride.&nbsp; Said
Pwyll, &ldquo;Tarry ye here the rest of the feast, and I will go
into England to tender my homage unto Caswallawn the son of
Beli.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Rhiannon,
&ldquo;Caswallawn is in Kent, thou mayest therefore tarry at the
feast, and wait until he shall be nearer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
will wait,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; So they finished the
feast.&nbsp; And they began to make the circuit of Dyved and to
hunt, and to take their pleasure.&nbsp; And as they went through
the country, they had never seen lands more pleasant to live in,
nor better hunting grounds, nor greater plenty of honey and
fish.&nbsp; And such was the friendship between those four, that
they would not be parted from each other by night nor by day.</p>
<p>And in the midst of all this he went to Caswallawn at Oxford,
and tendered his homage; and honourable was his reception there,
and highly was he praised for offering his homage.</p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>And after his return, Pryderi and Manawyddan feasted and
took their ease and pleasure.&nbsp; And they began a feast at
Narberth, for it was the chief palace; and there originated all
honour.&nbsp; And when they had ended the first meal that night,
while those who served them eat, they arose and went forth, and
proceeded all four to the Gorsedd of Narberth, and their retinue
with them.&nbsp; And as they sat thus, behold a peal of thunder,
and with the violence of the thunderstorm, lo there came a fall
of mist, so thick that not one of them could see the other.&nbsp;
And after the mist it became light all around.&nbsp; And when
they looked towards the place where they were wont to see cattle,
and herds, and dwellings, they saw nothing now, neither house,
nor beast, nor smoke, nor fire, nor man, nor dwelling; but the
houses of the court empty, and desert, and uninhabited, without
either man, or beast within them.&nbsp; And truly all their
companions were lost to them, without their knowing aught of what
had befallen them, save those four only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of Heaven,&rdquo; cried Manawyddan,
&ldquo;where are they of the court, and all my host beside
these?&nbsp; Let us go and see.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they came into
the hall, and there was no man; and they went on to the castle,
and to the sleeping-place, and they saw none; and in the
mead-cellar and in the kitchen there was nought but
desolation.&nbsp; So they four feasted, and hunted, and took
their pleasure.&nbsp; Then they began to go through the land and
all the possessions that they had, and they visited the houses
and dwellings, and found nothing but wild beasts.&nbsp; And when
they had consumed their feast and all their provisions, they fed
upon the prey they killed in <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>hunting, <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> and the honey of the wild swarms.&nbsp;
And thus they passed the first year pleasantly, and the second;
but at the last they began to be weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Manawyddan, &ldquo;we must not bide
thus.&nbsp; Let us go into England, and seek some craft whereby
we may gain our support.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they went into England,
and came as far as Hereford.&nbsp; And they betook themselves to
making saddles.&nbsp; And Manawyddan began to make housings, and
he gilded and coloured them with blue enamel, in the manner that
he had seen it done by Llasar Llaesgywydd.&nbsp; And he made the
blue enamel as it was made by the other man.&nbsp; And therefore
is it still called Calch Lassar, [blue enamel,] because Llassar
Llaesgywydd had wrought it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p65.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p65.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And as long as that workmanship could be had of Manawyddan,
neither saddle nor housing was bought of a saddler throughout all
Hereford; till at length <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>every one of
the saddlers perceived that they were losing much of their gain,
and that no man bought of them, but he who could not get what he
sought from Manawyddan.&nbsp; Then they assembled together, and
agreed to slay him and his companions.</p>
<p>Now they received warning of this, and took counsel whether
they should leave the city.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Heaven,&rdquo; said
Pryderi, &ldquo;it is not my counsel that we should quit the
town, but that we should slay these boors.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Manawyddan, &ldquo;for if we fight
with them, we shall have evil fame, and shall be put in
prison.&nbsp; It were better for us to go to another town to
maintain ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they four went to another
city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What craft shall we take?&rdquo; said Pryderi.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We will make shields,&rdquo; said Manawyddan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do we know anything about that craft?&rdquo; said
Pryderi.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will try,&rdquo; answered he.&nbsp;
There they began to make shields, and fashioned them after the
shape of the good shields they had seen; and they enamelled them,
as they had done the saddles.&nbsp; And they prospered in that
place, so that not a shield was asked for in the whole town, but
such as was had of them.&nbsp; Rapid therefore was their work,
and numberless were the shields they made.&nbsp; But at last they
were marked by the craftsmen, who came together in haste, and
their fellow-townsmen with them, and agreed that they should seek
to slay them.&nbsp; But they received warning, and heard how the
men had resolved on their destruction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pryderi,&rdquo; said Manawyddan, &ldquo;these men desire
to slay us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us not endure this from these
boors, but let us rather fall upon them and slay
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;Caswallawn and his men will hear of it, and we shall be
undone.&nbsp; <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Let us go to another
town.&rdquo;&nbsp; So to another town they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What craft shall we take?&rdquo; said Manawyddan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatsoever thou wilt that we know,&rdquo; said
Pryderi.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but let
us take to making shoes, for there is not courage among
cordwainers either to fight with us or to molest us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know nothing thereof,&rdquo; said Pryderi.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I know,&rdquo; answered Manawyddan; &ldquo;and I will
teach thee to stitch.&nbsp; We will not attempt to dress the
leather, but we will buy it ready dressed and will make the shoes
from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he began by buying the best cordwal that could be had in
the town, and none other would he buy except the leather for the
soles; and he associated himself with the best goldsmith in the
town, and caused him to make clasps for the shoes, and to gild
the clasps, and he marked how it was done until he learned the
method.&nbsp; And therefore was he called one of the three makers
of Gold Shoes; and, when they could be had from him, not a shoe
nor hose was bought of any of the cordwainers in the town.&nbsp;
But when the cordwainers perceived that their gains were failing,
(for as Manawyddan shaped the work, so Pryderi stitched it,) they
came together and took counsel, and agreed that they would slay
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pryderi,&rdquo; said Manawyddan, &ldquo;these men are
minded to slay us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore should we bear
this from the boorish thieves?&rdquo; said Pryderi.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rather let us slay them all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
so,&rdquo; said Manawyddan, &ldquo;we will not slay them, neither
will we remain in England any longer.&nbsp; Let us set forth to
Dyved and go to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they journeyed along until they came to Dyved, <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>and
they went forward to Narberth.&nbsp; And there they kindled a
fire and supported themselves by hunting.&nbsp; And thus they
spent a month.&nbsp; And they gathered their dogs around them,
and tarried there one year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p68.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p68.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And one morning Pryderi and Manawyddan rose up to hunt, and
they ranged their dogs and went forth from the palace.&nbsp; And
some of the dogs ran before them and came to a small bush which
was near at hand; but as soon as they were come to the bush, they
hastily drew back and returned to the men, their hair bristling
up greatly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us go near to the bush,&rdquo; said
Pryderi, &ldquo;and see what is in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as they
came near, behold, a wild boar of a pure white colour rose up
from the bush.&nbsp; Then the dogs being <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>set on by the
men, rushed towards him, but he left the bush and fell back a
little way from the men, and made a stand against the dogs
without retreating from them, until the men had come near.&nbsp;
And when the men came up, he fell back a second time, and betook
him to flight.&nbsp; Then they pursued the boar until they beheld
a vast and lofty castle, all newly built, in a place where they
had never before seen either stone or building.&nbsp; And the
boar ran swiftly into the castle and the dogs after him.&nbsp;
Now when the boar and the dogs had gone into the castle, they
began to wonder at finding a castle in a place where they had
never before then seen any building whatsoever.&nbsp; And from
the top of the Gorsedd they looked and listened for the
dogs.&nbsp; But so long as they were there they heard not one of
the dogs nor aught concerning them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Pryderi, &ldquo;I will go into the
castle to get tidings of the dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;thou wouldst be unwise to
go into this castle, which thou hast never seen till now.&nbsp;
If thou wouldst follow my counsel, thou wouldst not enter
therein.&nbsp; Whosoever has cast a spell over this land, has
caused this castle to be here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a
truth,&rdquo; answered Pryderi, &ldquo;I cannot thus give up my
dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; And for all the counsel that Manawyddan gave
him, yet to the castle he went.</p>
<p>When he came within the castle, neither man nor beast, nor
boar nor dogs, nor house nor dwelling saw he within it.&nbsp; But
in the centre of the castle floor he beheld a fountain with
marble work around it, and on the margin of the fountain a golden
bowl upon a marble slab, and chains hanging from the air, to
which he saw no end.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>And he was greatly pleased with the beauty of the gold,
and with the rich workmanship of the bowl, and he went up to the
bowl and laid hold of it.&nbsp; And when he had taken hold of it
his hands stuck to the bowl, and his feet to the slab on which
the bowl was placed, and all his joyousness forsook him, so that
he could not utter a word.&nbsp; And thus he stood.</p>
<p>And Manawyddan waited for him till near the close of the
day.&nbsp; And late in the evening, being certain that he should
have no tidings of Pryderi or of the dogs, he went back to the
palace.&nbsp; And as he entered, Rhiannon looked at him,
&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;are thy companion and thy
dogs?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;the
adventure that has befallen me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he related it
all unto her.&nbsp; &ldquo;An evil companion hast thou
been,&rdquo; said Rhiannon, &ldquo;and a good companion hast thou
lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that word she went out, and proceeded
towards the castle according to the direction which he gave
her.&nbsp; The gate of the castle she found open.&nbsp; She was
nothing daunted, and she went in.&nbsp; And as she went in, she
perceived Pryderi laying hold of the bowl, and she went towards
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh my lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what dost
thou here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she took hold of the bowl with him;
and as she did so, her hands also became fast to the bowl, and
her feet to the slab, and she was not able to utter a word.&nbsp;
And with that, as it became night, lo there came thunder upon
them, and a fall of mist, and thereupon the castle vanished, and
they with it.</p>
<p>When Kicva the daughter of Gwynn Gloew saw that there was no
one in the palace but herself and Manawyddan, she sorrowed so
that she cared not whether she lived or died.&nbsp; And
Manawyddan saw this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art in the wrong,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;if through <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>fear of me
thou grievest thus.&nbsp; I call Heaven to witness that thou hast
never seen friendship more pure than that which I will bear thee,
as long as Heaven will that thou shouldst be thus.&nbsp; I
declare to thee that were I in the dawn of youth I would keep my
faith unto Pryderi, and unto thee also will I keep it.&nbsp; Be
there no fear upon thee, therefore,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for
Heaven is my witness that thou shall meet with all the friendship
thou canst wish, and that it is in my power to show thee, as long
as it shall please Heaven to continue us in this grief and
woe.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward thee,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and that is what I deemed of thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
damsel thereupon took courage and was glad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, lady,&rdquo; said Manawyddan, &ldquo;it is not
fitting for us to stay here, we have lost our dogs, and we cannot
get food.&nbsp; Let us go into England; it is easiest for us to
find support there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly, lord,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;we will do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they set forth
together to England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;What craft wilt thou
follow?&nbsp; Take up one that is seemly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;None other will I take,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;save
that of making shoes, as I did formerly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;such a craft becomes not a
man so nobly born as thou.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By that however
will I abide,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>So he began his craft, and he made all his work of the finest
leather he could get in the town, and, as he had done at the
other place, he caused gilded clasps to be made for the shoes. <a
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; And except himself all the
cordwainers in the town were idle, and without work.&nbsp; For as
long as they could be had from him, neither shoes nor hose were
bought elsewhere.&nbsp; <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>And thus they tarried there a year,
until the cordwainers became envious, and took counsel concerning
him.&nbsp; And he had warning thereof, and it was told him how
the cordwainers had agreed together to slay him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Kicva, &ldquo;Wherefore should this
be borne from these boors?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;we will go back unto Dyved.&rdquo;&nbsp; So towards
Dyved they set forth.</p>
<p>Now Manawyddan, when he set out to return to Dyved, took with
him a burden of wheat.&nbsp; And he proceeded towards Narberth,
and there he dwelt.&nbsp; And never was he better pleased than
when he saw Narberth again, and the lands where he had been wont
to hunt with Pryderi and with Rhiannon.&nbsp; And he accustomed
himself to fish, and to hunt the deer in their covert.&nbsp; And
then he began to prepare some ground and he sowed a croft, and a
second, and a third.&nbsp; And no wheat in the world ever sprung
up better.&nbsp; And the three crofts prospered with perfect
growth, and no man ever saw fairer wheat than it.</p>
<p>And thus passed the seasons of the year until the harvest
came.&nbsp; And he went to look at one of his crofts, and behold
it was ripe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will reap this to-morrow,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; And that night he went back to Narberth, and on the
morrow in the grey dawn he went to reap the croft, and when he
came there he found nothing but the bare straw.&nbsp; Every one
of the ears of the wheat was cut from off the stalk, and all the
ears carried entirely away, and nothing but the straw left.&nbsp;
And at this he marvelled greatly.</p>
<p>Then he went to look at another croft, and behold that also
was ripe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this will I
reap to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on the morrow he came with <!--
page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>the intent to reap it, and when he came there he found
nothing but the bare straw.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh gracious
Heaven,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I know that whosoever has
begun my ruin is completing it, and has also destroyed the
country with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went to look at the third croft, and when he came
there, finer wheat had there never been seen, and this also was
ripe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Evil betide me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I
watch not here to-night.&nbsp; Whoever carried off the other corn
will come in like manner to take this.&nbsp; And I will know who
it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he took his arms, and began to watch the
croft.&nbsp; And he told Kicva all that had befallen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what thinkest thou to
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will watch the croft to-night,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>And he went to watch the croft.&nbsp; And at midnight, lo!
there arose the loudest tumult in the world.&nbsp; And he looked,
and behold the mightiest host of mice in the world, which could
neither be numbered nor measured.&nbsp; And he knew not what it
was until the mice had made their way into the croft, and each of
them climbing up the straw and bending it down with its weight,
and had cut off one of the ears of wheat, and had carried it
away, leaving there the stalk, and he saw not a single straw
there that had not a mouse to it.&nbsp; And they all took their
way, carrying the ears with them.</p>
<p>In wrath and anger did he rush upon the mice, but he could no
more come up with them than if they had been gnats, or birds in
the air, except one only, which though it was but sluggish, went
so fast that a man on foot could scarce overtake it. <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a>&nbsp; And after <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>this one he
went, and he caught it and put it in his glove, and tied up the
opening of the glove with a string, and kept it with him, and
returned to the palace.&nbsp; Then he came to the hall where
Kicva was, and he lighted a fire, and hung the glove by the
string upon a peg.&nbsp; &ldquo;What hast thou there,
lord?&rdquo; said Kicva.&nbsp; &ldquo;A thief,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that I found robbing me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What kind of
thief may it be, lord, that thou couldst put into thy
glove?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold I will tell
thee,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; Then he showed her how his fields
had been wasted and destroyed, and how the mice came to the last
of the fields in his sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;And one of them was less
nimble than the rest, and is now in my glove; to-morrow I will
hang it, and before Heaven, if I had them, I would hang them
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;this is
marvellous; but yet it would be unseemly for a man of dignity
like thee to be hanging such a reptile as this.&nbsp; And if thou
doest right, thou wilt not meddle with the creature, but wilt let
it go.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Woe betide me,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;if I would not hang them all could I catch them, and such
as I have I will hang.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, lord,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;there is no reason that I should succour this
reptile, except to prevent discredit unto thee.&nbsp; Do
therefore, lord, as thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I knew of
any cause in the world wherefore thou shouldst succour it, I
would take thy counsel concerning it,&rdquo; said Manawyddan,
&ldquo;but as I know of none, lady, I am minded to destroy
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do so willingly then,&rdquo; said
she.</p>
<p>And then he went to the Gorsedd of Narberth, <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>taking the
mouse with him.&nbsp; And he set up two forks on the highest part
of the Gorsedd.&nbsp; And while he was doing this, behold he saw
a scholar coming towards him, in old and poor and tattered
garments.&nbsp; And it was now seven years since he had seen in
that place either man or beast, except those four persons who had
remained together until two of them were lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the scholar, &ldquo;good day to
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven prosper thee, and my greeting be
unto thee.&nbsp; And whence dost thou come, scholar?&rdquo; asked
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come, lord, from singing in England; and
wherefore dost thou enquire?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because for the
last seven years,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I have seen no man
here save four secluded persons, and thyself this
moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly, lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
go through this land unto mine own.&nbsp; And what work art thou
upon, lord?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am hanging a thief that I
caught robbing me,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What manner of
thief is that?&rdquo; asked the scholar.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see a
creature in thy hand like unto a mouse, and ill does it become a
man of rank equal to thine, to touch a reptile such as
this.&nbsp; Let it go forth free.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not
let it go free, by Heaven,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I caught it
robbing me, and the doom of a thief will I inflict upon it and I
will hang it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;rather than see a man of rank equal to thine at such a
work as this, I would give thee a pound which I have received as
alms, to let the reptile go forth free.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will not let it go free,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by Heaven,
neither will I sell it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As thou wilt,
lord,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;except that I would not see a
man of rank equal to thine touching such a reptile, I care
nought.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the scholar went his way.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>And as he was placing the cross-beam upon the two forks,
behold a priest came towards him upon a horse covered with
trappings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good day to thee, lord,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven prosper thee,&rdquo; said Manawyddan;
&ldquo;thy blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The blessing of Heaven
be upon thee.&nbsp; And what, lord, art thou doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What manner of thief, lord?&rdquo; asked
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;A creature,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;in form
of a mouse.&nbsp; It has been robbing me, and I am inflicting
upon it the doom of a thief.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;rather than see thee touch this reptile, I would
purchase its freedom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By my confession to
Heaven, neither will I sell it nor set it free.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is true, lord, that it is worth nothing to buy; but
rather than see thee defile thyself by touching such a reptile as
this, I will give thee three pounds to let it go.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will not, by Heaven,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take any
price for it.&nbsp; As it ought, so shall it be
hanged.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Willingly, lord, do thy good
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the priest went his way.</p>
<p>Then he noosed the string around the mouse&rsquo;s neck, and
as he was about to draw it up, behold, he saw a bishop&rsquo;s
retinue, with his sumpter-horses, and his attendants.&nbsp; And
the bishop himself came towards him.&nbsp; And he stayed his
work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord bishop,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thy
blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s blessing be unto
thee,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;What work art thou
upon?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hanging a thief that I caught robbing
me,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is not that a mouse that I see
in thy hand?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And she has robbed me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;since I have come at the doom of this reptile I
will ransom it of thee.&nbsp; I will give thee seven pounds for
it, and that rather than see a man of rank equal to thine
destroying so <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>vile a reptile as this.&nbsp; Let it
loose and thou shall have the money.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
declare to Heaven that I will not set it loose.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;If thou wilt not loose it for this, I will give thee four
and twenty pounds of ready money to set it free.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will not set it free, by Heaven, for as much
again,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou wilt not set it free
for this, I will give thee all the horses that thou seest in this
plain, and the seven loads of baggage, and the seven horses that
they are upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By Heaven, I will not,&rdquo;
he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since for this thou wilt not, do so at
what price soever thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do
so,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will that Rhiannon and Pryderi
be free,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;That thou shall
have,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not yet will I loose the
mouse, by Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What then wouldst
thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That the charm and the illusion be
removed from the seven Cantrevs of Dyved.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This shall thou have also, set therefore the mouse
free.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not set it free, by
Heaven,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will know who the mouse
may be.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She is my wife.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Even though she be, I will not set her free.&nbsp;
Wherefore came she to me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To despoil
thee,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am Llwyd the son of
Kilcoed, and I cast the charm over the seven Cantrevs of
Dyved.&nbsp; And it was to avenge Gwawl the son of Clud, from the
friendship I had towards him, that I cast the charm.&nbsp; And
upon Pryderi did I revenge Gwawl the son of Clud, for the game of
Badger in the Bag, that Pwyll Pen Annwn played upon him, which he
did unadvisedly in the court of Heveydd H&ecirc;n.&nbsp; And when
it was known that thou wast come to dwell in the land, my
household came and besought me to transform them into mice, that
they might destroy thy corn.&nbsp; And it was my own household
that went <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the first night.&nbsp; And the second
night also they went, and they destroyed thy two crofts.&nbsp;
And the third night came unto me my wife and the ladies of the
court, and besought me to transform them.&nbsp; And I transformed
them.&nbsp; Now she is pregnant.&nbsp; And had she not been
pregnant thou wouldst not have been able to overtake her, but
since this has taken place and she has been caught, I will
restore thee Pryderi and Rhiannon; and I will take the charm and
illusion from off Dyved.&nbsp; I have now told thee who she
is.&nbsp; Set her therefore free.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not
set her free, by Heaven,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What wilt
thou more?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will that there be no
more charm upon the seven Cantrevs of Dyved, and that none shall
be put upon it henceforth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This thou shalt
have,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now set her free.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will not by my faith,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What wilt thou furthermore,&rdquo; asked he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this will I have; that
vengeance be never taken for this, either upon Pryderi or
Rhiannon, or upon me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All this shalt thou
have.&nbsp; And truly thou hast done wisely in asking this.&nbsp;
Upon thy head would have lit all this trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for fear thereof was it, that
I required this.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Set now my wife at
liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not, by Heaven,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;until I see Pryderi and Rhiannon with me
free.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, here they come,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>And thereupon behold Pryderi and Rhiannon.&nbsp; And he rose
up to meet them, and greeted them, and sat down beside
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah chieftain, set now my wife at
liberty,&rdquo; said the bishop.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hast thou not
received all thou didst ask?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will release
her gladly,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And thereupon he set her
free.</p>
<p>Then he struck her with a magic wand, and she <!-- page
79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>was
changed back into a young woman, the fairest ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look around upon thy land,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
then thou wilt see it all tilled and peopled, as it was in its
best state.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he rose up and looked forth.&nbsp;
And when he looked he saw all the lands tilled, and full of herds
and dwellings.&nbsp; &ldquo;What bondage,&rdquo; he enquired,
&ldquo;has there been upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pryderi has had the knockers of the gate of my palace
about his neck, and Rhiannon has had the collars of the asses,
after they have been carrying hay, about her neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And such had been their bondage.</p>
<p>And by reason of this bondage is this story called the
Mabinogi of Mynnweir and Mynord. <a name="citation79"></a><a

80</span>MATH THE SON OF MATHONWY.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p80.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p80.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Math the son of Mathonwy was lord over Gwynedd, and Pryderi
the son of Pwyll was lord over the one and twenty Cantrevs of the
South; and these were the seven Cantrevs of Dyved, and the seven
Cantrevs <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>of Morganwc, the four Cantrevs of
Ceredigiawn, and the three of Ystrad Tywi.</p>
<p>At that time, Math the son of Mathonwy could not exist unless
his feet were in the lap of a maiden, except only when he was
prevented by the tumult of war.&nbsp; Now the maiden who was with
him was Goewin, the daughter of Pebin of D&ocirc;l Pebin, in
Arvon, and she was the fairest maiden of her time who was known
there.</p>
<p>And Math dwelt always at Caer Dathyl, in Arvon, and was not
able to go the circuit of the land, but Gilvaethwy the son of
Don, and Eneyd <a name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a> the son of Don, his nephews, the sons
of his sister, with his household, went the circuit of the land
in his stead.</p>
<p>Now the maiden was with Math continually, and Gilvaethwy the
son of Don set his affections upon her, and loved her so that he
knew not what he should do because of her, and therefrom behold
his hue, and his aspect, and his spirits changed for love of her,
so that it was not easy to know him.</p>
<p>One day his brother Gwydion gazed steadfastly upon him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Youth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what aileth
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;what
seest thou in me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that thou hast lost thy aspect and thy hue; what,
therefore, aileth thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord,
brother,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that which aileth me, it will
not profit me that I should own to any.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What
may it be, my soul?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
knowest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Math the son of Mathonwy has
this property, that if men whisper together, in a tone how low
soever, if the wind meet it, it becomes known unto
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gwydyon, &ldquo;hold
now thy peace, I know thy intent, thou lovest Goewin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>When he found that his brother knew his intent, he gave
the heaviest sigh in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be silent, my soul,
and sigh not,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not thereby that
thou wilt succeed.&nbsp; I will cause,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if
it cannot be otherwise, the rising of Gwynedd, and Powys, and
Deheubarth, to seek the maiden.&nbsp; Be thou of glad cheer
therefore, and I will compass it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went unto Math the son of Mathonwy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Gwydion, &ldquo;I have heard that there
have come to the South some beasts, such as were never known in
this island before.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are they
called?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pigs, lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what kind of animals are they?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are small animals, and their flesh is better than the
flesh of oxen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are small
then?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And they change their names.&nbsp;
Swine are they now called.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who owneth
them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pryderi the son of Pwyll; they were
sent him from Annwn, by Arawn the king of Annwn, and still they
keep that name, half hog, half pig.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;and by what means may they
be obtained from him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go, lord, as one
of twelve in the guise of bards, to seek the swine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But it may be that he will refuse you,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;My journey will not be evil, lord,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I will not come back without the swine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;go thou forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he and Gilvaethwy went, and ten other men with them.&nbsp;
And they came into Ceredigiawn, to the place that is now called
Rhuddlan Teivi, where the palace of Pryderi was.&nbsp; In the
guise of bards they came in, and they were received joyfully, and
Gwydion was placed beside Pryderi that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; said Pryderi, &ldquo;gladly would I
have a tale from some of your men yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>said Gwydion, &ldquo;we have a custom
that the first night that we come to the court of a great man,
the chief of song recites.&nbsp; Gladly will I relate a
tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now Gwydion was the best teller of tales in
the world, and he diverted all the court that night with pleasant
discourse and with tales, so that he charmed every one in the
court, and it pleased Pryderi to talk with him.</p>
<p>And after this, &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he unto Pryderi,
&ldquo;were it more pleasing to thee, that another should
discharge my errand unto thee, than that I should tell thee
myself what it is?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;ample speech hast thou.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, then,
lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my errand.&nbsp; It is to crave from
thee the animals that were sent thee from Annwn.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that were the easiest
thing in the world to grant, were there not a covenant between me
and my land concerning them.&nbsp; And the covenant is that they
shall not go from me, until they have produced double their
number in the land.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I can set thee free from these words, and this is the way
I can do so; give me not the swine to-night, neither refuse them
unto me, and to-morrow I will show thee an exchange for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that night he and his fellows went unto their lodging, and
they took counsel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, my men,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;we shall not have the swine for the asking.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;how may they be
obtained?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will cause them to be
obtained,&rdquo; said Gwydion.</p>
<p>Then he betook himself to his arts, and began to work a
charm.&nbsp; And he caused twelve chargers to appear, and twelve
black greyhounds, each of them white breasted, and having upon
them twelve collars and twelve leashes, such as no one that saw
them could know to be other than gold.&nbsp; And upon the <!--
page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>horses twelve saddles, and every part which should have
been of iron was entirely of gold, and the bridles were of the
same workmanship.&nbsp; And with the horses and the dogs he came
to Pryderi.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p84.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p84.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day unto thee, lord,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heaven prosper thee,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and
greetings be unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;behold here is a release for thee from the word which thou
spakest last evening concerning the swine; that thou wouldest
neither give nor sell them.&nbsp; Thou mayest exchange them for
that which is better.&nbsp; And I will give these twelve horses,
all caparisoned as they are, with their saddles and their
bridles, and these twelve greyhounds, with their collars and
their leashes as thou seest, and the <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>twelve gilded
shields that thou beholdest yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now these he had
formed of fungus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we
will take counsel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they consulted together, and
determined to give the swine to Gwydion, and to take his horses
and his dogs and his shields.</p>
<p>Then Gwydion and his men took their leave, and began to
journey forth with the pigs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, my comrades,&rdquo;
said Gwydion, &ldquo;it is needful that we journey with
speed.&nbsp; The illusion will not last but from the one hour to
the same to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that night they journeyed as far as the upper part of
Ceredigiawn, to the place which, from that cause, is called
Mochdrev still.&nbsp; And the next day they took their course
through Melenydd, and came that night to the town which is
likewise for that reason called Mochdrev, between Keri and
Arwystli.&nbsp; And thence they journeyed forward; and that night
they came as far as that Commot in Powys, which also upon account
thereof is called Mochnant, and there tarried they that
night.&nbsp; And they journeyed thence to the Cantrev of Rhos,
and the place where they were that night is still called
Mochdrev.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My men,&rdquo; said Gwydion, &ldquo;we must push
forward to the fastnesses of Gwynedd with these animals, for
there is a gathering of hosts in pursuit of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
they journeyed on to the highest town of Arllechwedd, and there
they made a sty for the swine, and therefore was the name of
Creuwyryon given to that town.&nbsp; And after they had made the
sty for the swine, they proceeded to Math the son of Mathonwy, at
Caerdathyl.&nbsp; And when they came there, the country was
rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;What news is there here?&rdquo; asked
Gwydion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pryderi is assembling one and <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>twenty Cantrevs to pursue after you,&rdquo; answered
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is marvellous that you should have
journeyed so slowly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are the animals
whereof you went in quest?&rdquo; said Math.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
have had a sty made for them in the other Cantrev below,&rdquo;
said Gwydion.</p>
<p>Thereupon, lo! they heard the trumpets and the host in the
land, and they arrayed themselves and set forward and came to
Penardd in Arvon.</p>
<p>And at night Gwydion the son of Don, and Gilvaethwy his
brother, returned to Caerdathyl; and Gilvaethwy took Math the son
of Mathonwy&rsquo;s couch.&nbsp; And while he turned out the
other damsels from the room discourteously, he made Goewin
unwillingly remain.</p>
<p>And when they saw the day on the morrow, they went back unto
the place where Math the son of Mathonwy was with his host; and
when they came there, the warriors were taking counsel in what
district they should await the coming of Pryderi, and the men of
the South.&nbsp; So they went in to the council.&nbsp; And it was
resolved to wait in the strongholds of Gwynedd, in Arvon.&nbsp;
So within the two Maenors they took their stand, Maenor Penardd
and Maenor Coed Alun.&nbsp; And there Pryderi attacked them, and
there the combat took place.&nbsp; And great was the slaughter on
both sides; but the men of the South were forced to flee.&nbsp;
And they fled unto the place which is still called
Nantcall.&nbsp; And thither did they follow them, and they made a
vast slaughter of them there, so that they fled again as far as
the place called Dol Pen Maen, and there they halted and sought
to make peace.</p>
<p>And that he might have peace, Pryderi gave hostages, Gwrgi
Gwastra gave he and three and <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>twenty
others, sons of nobles.&nbsp; And after this they journeyed in
peace even unto Traeth Mawr; but as they went on together towards
Melenryd, the men on foot could not be restrained from
shooting.&nbsp; Pryderi despatched unto Math an embassy to pray
him to forbid his people, and to leave it between him and Gwydion
the son of Don, for that he had caused all this.&nbsp; And the
messengers came to Math.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; said
Math, &ldquo;I call Heaven to witness, if it be pleasing unto
Gwydion the son of Don, I will so leave it gladly.&nbsp; Never
will I compel any to go to fight, but that we ourselves should do
our utmost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said the messengers, &ldquo;Pryderi
saith that it were more fair that the man who did him this wrong
should oppose his own body to his, and let his people remain
unscathed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare to Heaven, I will not
ask the men of Gwynedd to fight because of me.&nbsp; If I am
allowed to fight Pryderi myself, gladly will I oppose my body to
his.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this answer they took back to
Pryderi.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Pryderi, &ldquo;I shall
require no one to demand my rights but myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then these two came forth and armed themselves, and they
fought.&nbsp; And by force of strength, and fierceness, and by
the magic and charms of Gwydion, Pryderi was slain.&nbsp; And at
Maen Tyriawc, <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a> above Melenryd, was he buried, and
there is his grave.</p>
<p>And the men of the South set forth in sorrow towards their own
land; nor is it a marvel that they should grieve, seeing that
they had lost their lord, and many of their best warriors, and
for the most part, their horses and their arms.</p>
<p>The men of Gwynedd went back joyful and in <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Gwydion unto
Math, &ldquo;would it not be right for us to release the hostages
of the men of the South, which they pledged unto us for peace?
for we ought not to put them in prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
them then be set free,&rdquo; said Math.&nbsp; So that youth, and
the other hostages that were with him, were set free to follow
the men of the South.</p>
<p>Math himself went forward to Caerdathyl.&nbsp; Gilvaethwy the
son of Don, and they of the household that were with him went to
make the circuit of Gwynedd as they were wont, without coming to
the court.&nbsp; Math went into his chamber, and caused a place
to be prepared for him whereon to recline, so that he might put
his feet in the maiden&rsquo;s lap.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo;
said Goewin, &ldquo;seek now another <a name="citation88"></a><a
href="#footnote88" class="citation">[88]</a> to hold thy feet,
for I am now a wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What meaneth
this?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;An attack, lord, was made
unawares upon me; but I held not my peace, and there was no one
in the court who knew not of it.&nbsp; Now the attack was made by
thy nephews, lord, the sons of thy sister, Gwydion the son of
Don, and Gilvaethwy the son of Don; unto me they did wrong, and
unto thee dishonour.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;I will do to the utmost of my power concerning
this matter.&nbsp; But first I will cause thee to have
compensation, and then will I have amends made unto myself.&nbsp;
As for thee, I will take thee to be my wife, and the possession
of my dominions will I give unto thy hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Gwydion and Gilvaethwy came not near the court, but stayed
in the confines of the land until it was forbidden to give them
meat and drink.&nbsp; At first they came not near unto Math, but
at last they came.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;Good day to thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; <!--
page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>said he, &ldquo;is it to make me compensation that ye
are come?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we
are at thy will.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By my will I would not have
lost my warriors, and so many arms as I have done.&nbsp; You
cannot compensate me my shame, setting aside the death of
Pryderi.&nbsp; But since ye come hither to be at my will, I shall
begin your punishment forthwith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took his magic wand, and struck Gilvaethwy, so that he
became a deer, and he seized upon the other hastily lest he
should escape from him.&nbsp; And he struck him with the same
magic wand, and he became a deer also.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since now ye
are in bonds, I will that ye go forth together and be companions,
and possess the nature of the animals whose form ye bear.&nbsp;
And this day twelvemonth come hither unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of a year from that day, lo there was a loud noise
under the chamber wall, and the barking of the dogs of the palace
together with the noise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what is without.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said
one, &ldquo;I have looked; there are there two deer, and a fawn
with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he arose and went out.&nbsp; And
when he came he beheld the three animals.&nbsp; And he lifted up
his wand.&nbsp; &ldquo;As ye were deer last year, be ye wild hogs
each and either of you, for the year that is to
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he struck them with the magic
wand.&nbsp; &ldquo;The young one will I take and cause to be
baptized.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the name that he gave him was
Hydwn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go ye and be wild swine, each and either of
you, and be ye of the nature of wild swine.&nbsp; And this day
twelvemonth be ye here under the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the year the barking of dogs was heard under the
wall of the chamber.&nbsp; And the court <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>assembled,
and thereupon he arose and went forth, and when he came forth he
beheld three beasts.&nbsp; Now these were the beasts that he saw;
two wild hogs of the woods, and a well-grown young one with
them.&nbsp; And he was very large for his age.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Math, &ldquo;this one will I take and
cause to be baptized.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he struck him with his
magic wand, and he became a fine fair auburn haired youth, and
the name that he gave him was Hychdwn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now as for
you, as ye were wild hogs last year, be ye wolves each and either
of you for the year that is to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he
struck them with his magic wand, and they became wolves.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And be ye of like nature with the animals whose semblance
ye bear, and return here this day twelvemonth beneath this
wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the same day at the end of the year, he heard a clamour
and a barking of dogs under the wall of the chamber.&nbsp; And he
rose and went forth.&nbsp; And when he came, behold he saw two
wolves, and a strong cub with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;This one will I
take,&rdquo; said Math, &ldquo;and I will cause him to be
baptized; there is a name prepared for him, and that is
Bleiddwn.&nbsp; Now these three, such are they;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The three sons of Gilvaethwy the false,<br
/>
The three faithful combatants,<br />
Bleiddwn, Hydwn, and Hychdwn the Tall.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he struck the two with his magic wand, and they resumed
their own nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for
the wrong that ye did unto me, sufficient has been your
punishment and your dishonour.&nbsp; Prepare now precious
ointment for these men, and wash their heads, and equip
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this was done.</p>
<p>And after they were equipped, they came unto him.&nbsp; <!--
page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;Oh men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have obtained
peace, and you shall likewise have friendship.&nbsp; Give your
counsel unto me, what maiden I shall seek.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Gwydion the son of Don, &ldquo;it is
easy to give thee counsel; seek Arianrod, <a
name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a"
class="citation">[91a]</a> the daughter of Don, thy niece, thy
sister&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they brought her unto him, and the maiden came in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ha damsel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;art thou the
maiden?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not, Lord, other than that I
am.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he took up his magic wand, and bent
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Step over this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I
shall know if thou art the maiden.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then stepped she
over the magic wand, and there appeared forthwith a fine chubby
yellow haired boy.&nbsp; And at the crying out of the boy, she
went towards the door.&nbsp; And thereupon some small form was
seen; but before any one could get a second glimpse of it,
Gwydion had taken it, and had flung a scarf of velvet around it
and hidden it.&nbsp; Now the place where he hid it was the bottom
of a chest at the foot of his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Math the son of Mathonwy,
concerning the fine yellow haired boy, &ldquo;I will cause this
one to be baptized, and Dylan is the name I will give
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they had the boy baptized, and as they baptized him he
plunged into the sea.&nbsp; And immediately when he was in the
sea, he took its nature, and swam as well as the best fish that
was therein.&nbsp; And for that reason was he called Dylan, the
son of the Wave.&nbsp; Beneath him no wave ever broke.&nbsp; And
the blow whereby he came to his death, was struck by his uncle
Govannion.&nbsp; The third fatal <a name="citation91b"></a><a
href="#footnote91b" class="citation">[91b]</a> blow was it
called.</p>
<p>As Gwydion lay one morning on his bed awake, he <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>heard
a cry in the chest at his feet; and though it was not loud, it
was such that he could hear it.&nbsp; Then he arose in haste, and
opened the chest; and when he opened it, he beheld an infant boy
stretching out his arms from the folds of the scarf, and casting
it aside.&nbsp; And he took up the boy in his arms, and carried
him to a place where he knew there was a woman that could nurse
him.&nbsp; And he agreed with the woman that she should take
charge of the boy.&nbsp; And that year he was nursed.</p>
<p>And at the end of the year, he seemed by his size as though he
were two years old.&nbsp; And the second year he was a big child,
and able to go to the court by himself.&nbsp; And when he came to
the court, Gwydion noticed him, and the boy became familiar with
him, and loved him better than any one else.&nbsp; Then was the
boy reared at the court until he was four years old, when he was
as big as though he had been eight.</p>
<p>And one day Gwydion walked forth, and the boy followed him,
and he went to the Castle of Arianrod, having the boy with him;
and when he came into the court, Arianrod arose to meet him, and
greeted him and bade him welcome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven prosper
thee,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is the boy that followeth
thee?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;This youth, he is thy
son,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;what has come unto thee that thou shouldest shame me thus,
wherefore dost thou seek my dishonour, and retain it so long as
this?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless thou suffer dishonour greater
than that of my bringing up such a boy as this, small will be thy
disgrace.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the name of the boy?&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;he has
not yet a name.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I lay this destiny upon <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>him, that he
shall never have a name until he receives one from
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven bears me witness,&rdquo; answered
he, &ldquo;that thou art a wicked woman.&nbsp; But the boy shall
have a name how displeasing soever it may be unto thee.&nbsp; As
for thee, that which afflicts thee is that thou art no longer
called a damsel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he went forth in
wrath, and returned to Caer Dathyl, and there he tarried that
night.</p>
<p>And the next day he arose and took the boy with him, and went
to walk on the sea shore between that place and Aber Menei.&nbsp;
And there he saw some sedges and sea weed, and he turned them
into a boat.&nbsp; And out of dry sticks <a
name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a> and sedges he made some Cordovan
leather, and a great deal thereof, and he coloured it in such a
manner that no one ever saw leather more beautiful than it.&nbsp;
Then he made a sail to the boat, and he and the boy went in it to
the Port of the Castle of Arianrod.&nbsp; And he began forming
shoes and stitching them, until he was observed from the
castle.&nbsp; And when he knew that they of the castle were
observing him, he disguised his aspect, and put another semblance
upon himself, and upon the boy, so that they might not be
known.&nbsp; &ldquo;What men are those in yonder boat?&rdquo;
said Arianrod.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are cordwainers,&rdquo; answered
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go and see what kind of leather they have, and
what kind of work they can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they came unto them.&nbsp; And when they came he was
colouring some Cordovan leather, and gilding it.&nbsp; And the
messengers came and told her this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;take the measure of my foot, and desire the
cordwainer to make shoes for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he made the
shoes for her, yet not according <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>to the
measure, but larger.&nbsp; The shoes then were brought unto her,
and behold they were too large.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are too
large,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but he shall receive their
value.&nbsp; Let him also make some that are smaller than
they.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he made her others that were much smaller
than her foot, and sent them unto her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell him that
these will not go on my feet,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; And they
told him this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will
not make her any shoes, unless I see her foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
this was told unto her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;I will go unto him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she went down to the boat, and when she came there, he was
shaping shoes and the boy stitching them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;good day to thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heaven prosper thee,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
marvel that thou canst not manage to make shoes according to a
measure.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;but now I shall be able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon behold a wren stood upon the deck of the boat, and
the boy shot at it, and hit it in the leg between the sinew and
the bone.&nbsp; Then she smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;with a steady hand did the lion aim at
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward thee not, but now has he
got a name.&nbsp; And a good enough name it is.&nbsp; Llew Llaw
Gyffes be he called henceforth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the work disappeared in sea weed and sedges, and he went
on with it no further.&nbsp; And for that reason was he called
the third Gold-shoemaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;thou wilt not thrive the better for doing evil unto
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have done thee no evil yet,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; Then he restored the boy to his own form.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will lay a destiny upon
this boy, that he shall never have arms and armour until I invest
him with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>Heaven,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let thy malice be what it
may, he shall have arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they went towards Dinas Dinllev, and there he brought up
Llew Llaw Gyffes, until he could manage any horse, and he was
perfect in features, and strength, and stature.&nbsp; And then
Gwydion saw that he languished through the want of horses, and
arms.&nbsp; And he called him unto him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
youth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will go to-morrow on an errand
together.&nbsp; Be therefore more cheerful than thou
art.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; said the youth.</p>
<p>Next morning, at the dawn of day, they arose.&nbsp; And they
took their way along the sea coast, up towards Bryn Aryen.&nbsp;
And at the top of Cevn Clydno they equipped themselves with
horses, and went towards the Castle of Arianrod.&nbsp; And they
changed their form, and pricked towards the gate in the semblance
of two youths, but the aspect of Gwydion was more staid than that
of the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Porter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;go thou
in and say that there are here bards from Glamorgan.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the porter went in.&nbsp; &ldquo;The welcome of Heaven be
unto them, let them in,&rdquo; said Arianrod.</p>
<p>With great joy were they greeted.&nbsp; And the hall was
arranged, and they went to meat.&nbsp; When meat was ended,
Arianrod discoursed with Gwydion of tales and stories.&nbsp; Now
Gwydion was an excellent teller of tales.&nbsp; And when it was
time to leave off feasting, a chamber was prepared for them, and
they went to rest.</p>
<p>In the early twilight Gwydion arose, and he called unto him
his magic and his power.&nbsp; And by the time that the day
dawned, there resounded through the land uproar, and trumpets,
and shouts.&nbsp; When it was <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>now day, they
heard a knocking at the door of the chamber, and therewith
Arianrod asking that it might be opened.&nbsp; Up rose the youth
and opened unto her, and she entered and a maiden with her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, good men,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in evil plight are
we.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes truly,&rdquo; said Gwydion, &ldquo;we
have heard trumpets, and shouts; what thinkest thou that they may
mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we
cannot see the colour of the ocean by reason of all the ships,
side by side.&nbsp; And they are making for the land with all the
speed they can.&nbsp; And what can we do?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Gwydion, &ldquo;there is none other
counsel than to close the castle upon us, and to defend it as
best we may.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;may Heaven reward you.&nbsp; And do you defend it.&nbsp;
And here you may have plenty of arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon went she forth for the arms, and behold she
returned, and two maidens, and suits of armour for two men, with
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do thou accoutre
this stripling, and I will arm myself with the help of thy
maidens.&nbsp; Lo, I hear the tumult of the men
approaching.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so,
gladly.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she armed him fully, and that right
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hast thou finished arming the
youth,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have finished,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I likewise have finished,&rdquo; said
Gwydion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us now take off our arms, we have no
need of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is the army around the house.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, lady, there is here no army.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;Whence then was this
tumult?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The tumult was but to break thy
prophecy <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a> and to obtain arms for thy son.&nbsp;
And now has he got arms without any thanks unto
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By Heaven,&rdquo; said <!-- page
97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>Arianrod, &ldquo;thou art a wicked man.&nbsp; Many a
youth might have lost his life, through the uproar thou hast
caused in this Cantrev to-day.&nbsp; Now will I lay a destiny
upon this youth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that he shall never have
a wife of the race that now inhabits this earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou wast ever a malicious
woman, and no one ought to support thee.&nbsp; A wife shall he
have notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p97.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p97.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>They went thereupon unto Math the son of Mathonwy, and
complained unto him most bitterly of Arianrod.&nbsp; Gwydion
showed him also how he had procured arms for the youth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Math, &ldquo;we will seek, I and thou,
by charms and illusion, to form a wife for him out of
flowers.&nbsp; He has now <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>come to
man&rsquo;s stature, and he is the comeliest youth that was ever
beheld.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they took the blossoms of the oak, and
the blossoms of the broom, and the blossoms of the meadow-sweet,
and produced from them a maiden, the fairest and most graceful
that man ever saw.&nbsp; And they baptized her, <a
name="citation98a"></a><a href="#footnote98a"
class="citation">[98a]</a> and gave her the name of
Blodeuwedd.</p>
<p>After she had become his bride, and they had feasted, said
Gwydion, &ldquo;It is not easy for a man to maintain himself
without possessions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; said
Math, &ldquo;I will give the young man the best Cantrev to
hold.&rdquo; <a name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what Cantrev is that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Cantrev of
Dinodig,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; Now it is called at this day
Eivionydd and Ardudwy.&nbsp; And the place in the Cantrev where
he dwelt, was a palace of his in a spot called Mur y Castell, on
the confines of Ardudwy.&nbsp; There dwelt he and reigned, and
both he and his sway were beloved by all.</p>
<p>One day he went forth to Caer Dathyl, to visit Math the son of
Mathonwy.&nbsp; And on the day that he set out for Caer Dathyl,
Blodeuwedd walked in the court.&nbsp; And she heard the sound of
a horn.&nbsp; And after the sound of the horn, behold, a tired
stag went by, with dogs and huntsmen following it.&nbsp; And
after the dogs and the huntsmen there came a crowd of men on
foot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Send a youth,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to ask
who yonder host may be.&rdquo;&nbsp; So a youth went, and
enquired who they were.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gronw Pebyr is this, the
lord of Penllynn,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; And thus the youth told
her.</p>
<p>Gronw Pebyr pursued the stag, and by the river <!-- page
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>Cynvael he overtook the stag and killed it.&nbsp; And
what, with flaying the stag and baiting his dogs, he was there
until the night began to close in upon him.&nbsp; And as the day
departed and the night drew near, he came to the gate of the
court.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Blodeuwedd, &ldquo;the
chieftain will speak ill of us, if we let him at this hour depart
to another land without inviting him in.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
truly, lady,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;it will be most fitting to
invite him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then went messengers to meet him and bid him in.&nbsp; And he
accepted her bidding gladly, and came to the court, and
Blodeuwedd went to meet him and greeted him, and bade him
welcome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Heaven repay
thee thy kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had disaccoutred themselves, they went to sit
down.&nbsp; And Blodeuwedd looked upon him, and from the moment
that she looked on him she became filled with his love.&nbsp; And
he gazed on her, and the same thought came unto him as unto her,
so that he could not conceal from her that he loved her, but he
declared unto her that he did so.&nbsp; Thereupon she was very
joyful.&nbsp; And all their discourse that night was concerning
the affection and love which they felt one for the other, and
which in no longer space than one evening had arisen.&nbsp; And
that evening passed they in each other&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>The next day he sought to depart.&nbsp; But she said, &ldquo;I
pray thee go not from me to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that night he
tarried also.&nbsp; And that night they consulted by what means
they might always be together.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is none other
counsel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but that thou strive to learn
from Llew Llaw Gyffes in what manner he will meet his
death.&nbsp; And this must thou do under the semblance of
solicitude concerning him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>The next day Gronw sought to depart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I would counsel thee not
to go from me to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At thy instance, will I
not go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;albeit, I must say, there is
danger, that the chief who owns the palace may return
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; answered she,
&ldquo;will I indeed permit thee to go forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day he sought to go, and she hindered him not.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be mindful,&rdquo; said Gronw, &ldquo;of what I have said
unto thee, and converse with him fully, and that under the guise
of the dalliance of love, and find out by what means he may come
to his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Llew Llaw Gyffes returned to his home.&nbsp; And
the day they spent in discourse, and minstrelsy, and
feasting.&nbsp; And at night they went to rest, and he spoke to
Blodeuwedd once, and he spoke to her a second time.&nbsp; But,
for all this, he could not get from her one word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What aileth thee,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;art thou
well?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;of that which thou didst never think of concerning me; for
I was sorrowful as to thy death, lest thou shouldest go sooner
than I.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward thy care for me,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;but until Heaven take me I shall not easily be
slain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For the sake of Heaven, and for mine,
show me how thou mightest be slain.&nbsp; My memory in guarding
is better than thine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell thee
gladly,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not easily can I be slain,
except by a wound. <a name="citation100"></a><a
href="#footnote100" class="citation">[100]</a>&nbsp; And the
spear wherewith I am struck must be a year in the forming.&nbsp;
And nothing must be done towards it except during the sacrifice
on Sundays.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this certain?&rdquo; asked
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is in truth,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I cannot be slain within a house, nor without.&nbsp; I
cannot be slain <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>on horseback nor on
foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;in what
manner then canst thou be slain?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell
thee,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;By making a bath for me by the
side of a river, and by putting a roof over the cauldron, and
thatching it well and tightly, and bringing a buck, and putting
it beside the cauldron.&nbsp; Then if I place one foot on the
buck&rsquo;s back, and the other on the edge of the cauldron,
whosoever strikes me thus will cause my death.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I thank Heaven that it will
be easy to avoid this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had she held this discourse than she sent to Gronw
Pebyr.&nbsp; Gronw toiled at making the spear, and that day
twelvemonth it was ready.&nbsp; And that very day he caused her
to be informed thereof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Blodeuwedd unto Llew, &ldquo;I have
been thinking how it is possible that what thou didst tell me
formerly can be true; wilt thou show me in what manner thou
couldst stand at once upon the edge of a cauldron and upon a
buck, if I prepare the bath for thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
show thee,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Then she sent unto Gronw, and bade him be in ambush on the
hill which is now called Bryn Kyvergyr, on the bank of the river
Cynvael.&nbsp; She caused also to be collected all the goats that
were in the Cantrev, and had them brought to the other side of
the river, opposite Bryn Kyvergyr.</p>
<p>And the next day she spoke thus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;I have caused the roof and the bath to be
prepared, and lo! they are ready.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Llew, &ldquo;we will go gladly to look
at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day after they came and looked at the bath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wilt thou go into the bath, lord?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Willingly will I go in,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; So into
the <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>bath he went, and he anointed
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;behold the
animals which thou didst speak of as being called
bucks.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;cause one
of them to be caught and brought here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the buck
was brought.&nbsp; Then Llew rose out of the bath, and put on his
trowsers, and he placed one foot on the edge of the bath and the
other on the buck&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Thereupon Gronw rose up from the hill which is called Bryn
Cyvergyr, and he rested on one knee, and flung the poisoned dart
and struck him on the side, so that the shaft started out, but
the head of the dart remained in.&nbsp; Then he flew up in the
form of an eagle, and gave a fearful scream.&nbsp; And
thenceforth was he no more seen.</p>
<p>As soon as he departed Gronw and Blodeuwedd went together unto
the palace that night.&nbsp; And the next day Gronw arose and
took possession of Ardudwy.&nbsp; And after he had overcome the
land, he ruled over it, so that Ardudwy and Penllyn were both
under his sway.</p>
<p>Then these tidings reached Math the son of Mathonwy.&nbsp; And
heaviness and grief came upon Math, and much more upon Gwydion
than upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Gwydion, &ldquo;I
shall never rest until I have tidings of my nephew.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Math, &ldquo;may Heaven be thy
strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Gwydion set forth and began to go
forward.&nbsp; And he went through Gwynedd and Powys to the
confines.&nbsp; And when he had done so, he went into Arvon, and
came to the house of a vassal, in Maenawr Penardd.&nbsp; And he
alighted at the house, and stayed there that night.&nbsp; The man
of the house and his household came in, and last of all came
there the swineherd.&nbsp; Said the <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>man of the
house to the swineherd, &ldquo;Well, youth, hath thy sow come in
to-night?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She hath,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and is this instant returned to the pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where doth this sow go to?&rdquo; said Gwydion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Every day, when the sty is opened, she goeth forth and
none can catch sight of her, neither is it known whither she
goeth more than if she sank into the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wilt thou grant unto me,&rdquo; said Gwydion, &ldquo;not
to open the sty until I am beside the sty with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This will I do, right gladly,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>That night they went to rest; and as soon as the swineherd saw
the light of day, he awoke Gwydion.&nbsp; And Gwydion arose and
dressed himself, and went with the swineherd, and stood beside
the sty.&nbsp; Then the swineherd opened the sty.&nbsp; And as
soon as he opened it, behold, she leaped forth, and set off with
great speed.&nbsp; And Gwydion followed her, and she went against
the course of a river, and made for a brook, which is now called
Nant y Llew.&nbsp; And there she halted and began feeding.&nbsp;
And Gwydion came under the tree, and looked what it might be that
the sow was feeding on.&nbsp; And he saw that she was eating
putrid flesh and vermin.&nbsp; Then looked he up to the top of
the tree, and as he looked he beheld on the top of the tree an
eagle, and when the eagle shook itself, there fell vermin and
putrid flesh from off it, and these the sow devoured.&nbsp; And
it seemed to him that the eagle was Llew.&nbsp; And he sang an
Englyn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oak that grows between the two banks;<br />
Darkened is the sky and hill!<br />
Shall I not tell him by his wounds,<br />
That this is Llew?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Upon this the eagle came down until he reached the
centre of the tree.&nbsp; And Gwydion sang another Englyn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oak that grows in upland ground,<br />
Is it not wetted by the rain?&nbsp; Has it not been drenched<br
/>
By nine score tempests?<br />
It bears in its branches Llew Llaw Gyffes!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the eagle came down until he was on the lowest branch of
the tree, and thereupon this Englyn did Gwydion sing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oak that grows beneath the steep;<br />
Stately and majestic is its aspect!<br />
Shall I not speak it?<br />
That Llew will come to my lap?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the eagle came down upon Gwydion&rsquo;s knee.&nbsp; And
Gwydion struck him with his magic wand, so that he returned to
his own form.&nbsp; No one ever saw a more piteous sight, for he
was nothing but skin and bone.</p>
<p>Then he went unto Caer Dathyl, and there were brought unto him
good physicians that were in Gwynedd, and before the end of the
year he was quite healed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he unto Math the son of Mathonwy,
&ldquo;it is full time now that I have retribution of him by whom
I have suffered all this woe.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
said Math, &ldquo;he will never be able to maintain himself in
the possession of that which is thy right.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Llew, &ldquo;the sooner I have my right,
the better shall I be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they called together the whole of Gwynedd, and set forth
to Ardudwy.&nbsp; And Gwydion went on <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>before and
proceeded to Mur y Castell.&nbsp; And when Blodeuwedd heard that
he was coming, she took her maidens with her, and fled to the
mountain.&nbsp; And they passed through the river Cynvael, and
went towards a court that there was upon the mountain, and
through fear they could not proceed except with their faces
looking backwards, so that unawares they fell into the
lake.&nbsp; And they were all drowned except Blodeuwedd herself,
and her Gwydion overtook.&nbsp; And he said unto her, &ldquo;I
will not slay thee, but I will do unto thee worse than
that.&nbsp; For I will turn thee into a bird; and because of the
shame thou hast done unto Llew Llaw Gyffes, thou shall never show
thy face in the light of day henceforth; and that through fear of
all the other birds.&nbsp; For it shall be their nature to attack
thee, and to chase thee from wheresoever they may find
thee.&nbsp; And thou shalt not lose thy name, but shalt be always
called Blodeuwedd.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now Blodeuwedd is an owl in the
language of this present time, and for this reason is the owl
hateful unto all birds.&nbsp; And even now the owl is called
Blodeuwedd.</p>
<p>Then Gronw Pebyr withdrew unto Penllyn, and he despatched
thence an embassy.&nbsp; And the messengers he sent, asked Llew
Llaw Gyffes, if he would take land, or domain, or gold, or
silver, for the injury he had received.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not,
by my confession to Heaven,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold
this is the least that I will accept from him; that he come to
the spot where I was when he wounded me with the dart, and that I
stand where he did, and that with a dart I take my aim at
him.&nbsp; And this is the very least that I will
accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was told unto Gronw Pebyr.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>said he, &ldquo;is it needful for me
to do thus?&nbsp; My faithful warriors, and my household, and my
foster-brothers, is there not one among you who will stand the
blow in my stead?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is not,
verily,&rdquo; answered they.&nbsp; And because of their refusal
to suffer one stroke for their lord, they are called the third
disloyal tribe even unto this day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I will meet it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p106.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p106.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Then they two went forth to the banks of the river Cynvael,
and Gronw stood in the place where Llew Llaw Gyffes was when he
struck him, and Llew in the place where Gronw was.&nbsp; Then
said Gronw Pebyr unto Llew, &ldquo;Since it was through the wiles
of a woman that I did unto thee as I have done, I adjure thee by
Heaven to let me place between me and the blow, the slab thou
seest yonder on the river&rsquo;s bank.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Llew, &ldquo;I will not refuse thee
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may Heaven
reward thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; So <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Gronw took
the slab and placed it between him and the blow.</p>
<p>Then Llew flung the dart at him, and it pierced the slab and
went through Gronw likewise, so that it pierced through his
back.&nbsp; And thus was Gronw Pebyr slain.&nbsp; And there is
still the slab on the bank of the river Cynvael, in Ardudwy,
having the hole through it.&nbsp; And therefore it is even now
called Llech Gronw.</p>
<p>A second time did Llew Llaw Gyffes take possession of the
land, and prosperously did he govern it.&nbsp; And as the story
relates, he was lord after this over Gwynedd.&nbsp; And thus ends
this portion of the Mabinogi.</p>
<h2><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>HERE IS THE STORY OF LLUDD AND
LLEVELYS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p108.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p108.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Beli the Great, son of Manogan, had three sons, Lludd, and
Caswallawn, and Nynyaw; and according to the story he had a
fourth son called Llevelys.&nbsp; And after the death of Beli,
the kingdom of the Island of Britain fell into the hands of Lludd
his eldest son; and Lludd ruled prosperously, and rebuilt the
walls of London, and encompassed it about <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>with
numberless towers.&nbsp; And after that he bade the citizens
build houses therein, such as no houses in the kingdom could
equal.&nbsp; And moreover he was a mighty warrior, and generous
and liberal in giving meat and drink to all that sought
them.&nbsp; And though he had many castles and cities, this one
loved he more than any.&nbsp; And he dwelt therein most part of
the year, and therefore was it called Caer Ludd, and at last Caer
London.&nbsp; And after the stranger-race came there, it was
called London, or Lwndrys.</p>
<p>Lludd loved Llevelys best of all his brothers, because he was
a wise and a discreet man.&nbsp; Having heard that the king of
France had died, leaving no heir, except a daughter, and that he
had left all his possessions in her hands, he came to Lludd his
brother, to beseech his counsel and aid.&nbsp; And that not so
much for his own welfare, as to seek to add to the glory and
honour and dignity of his kindred, if he might go to France to
woo the maiden for his wife.&nbsp; And forthwith his brother
conferred with him, and this counsel was pleasing unto him.</p>
<p>So he prepared ships and filled them with armed knights, and
set forth towards France.&nbsp; And as soon as they had landed,
they sent messengers to show the nobles of France the cause of
the embassy.&nbsp; And by the joint counsel of the nobles of
France and of the princes, the maiden was given to Llevelys, and
the crown of the kingdom with her.&nbsp; And thenceforth he ruled
the land discreetly, and wisely, and happily, as long as his life
lasted.</p>
<p>After a space of time had passed, three plagues fell on the
Island of Britain, such as none in the Islands had ever seen the
like.&nbsp; The first was a certain race that came, and was
called the Coranians; and so <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>great was
their knowledge, that there was no discourse upon the face of the
Island, however low it might be spoken, but what, if the wind met
it, it was known to them.&nbsp; And through this they could not
be injured.</p>
<p>The second plague was a shriek which came on every May eve,
over every hearth in the Island of Britain.&nbsp; And this went
through people&rsquo;s hearts, and so scared them, that the men
lost their hue and their strength, and the women their children,
and the young men, and the maidens lost their senses, and all the
animals and trees and the earth and the waters, were left
barren.</p>
<p>The third plague was, that however much of provisions and food
might be prepared in the king&rsquo;s courts, were there even so
much as a year&rsquo;s provision of meat and drink, none of it
could ever be found, except what was consumed in the first
night.&nbsp; And two of these plagues, no one ever knew their
cause, therefore was there better hope of being freed from the
first than from the second and third.</p>
<p>And thereupon King Lludd felt great sorrow and care, because
that he knew not how he might be freed from these plagues.&nbsp;
And he called to him all the nobles of his kingdom, and asked
counsel of them what they should do against these
afflictions.&nbsp; And by the common counsel of the nobles, Lludd
the son of Beli, went to Llevelys his brother, king of France,
for he was a man great of counsel and wisdom, to seek his
advice.</p>
<p>And they made ready a fleet, and that in secret and in
silence, lest that race should know the cause of their errand, or
any besides the king and his counsellors.&nbsp; And when they
were made ready, they went into their ships, Lludd and those whom
he <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>chose with him.&nbsp; And they began to cleave the seas
towards France.</p>
<p>And when these tidings came to Llevelys, seeing that he knew
not the cause of his brother&rsquo;s ships, he came on the other
side to meet him, and with him was a fleet vast of size.&nbsp;
And when Lludd saw this, he left all the ships out upon the sea
except one only; and in that one he came to meet his brother, and
he likewise with a single ship came to meet him.&nbsp; And when
they were come together, each put his arms about the
other&rsquo;s neck, and they welcomed each other with brotherly
love.</p>
<p>After that Lludd had shewn his brother the cause of his
errand, Llevelys said that he himself knew the cause of the
coming to those lands.&nbsp; And they took counsel together to
discourse <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a> on the matter otherwise than thus, in
order that the wind might not catch their words, nor the
Coranians know what they might say.&nbsp; Then Llevelys caused a
long horn to be made of brass, and through this horn they
discoursed.&nbsp; But whatsoever words they spoke through this
horn, one to the other, neither of them could hear any other but
harsh and hostile words.&nbsp; And when Llevelys saw this, and
that there was a demon thwarting them and disturbing through this
horn, he caused wine to be put therein to wash it.&nbsp; And
through the virtue of the wine the demon was driven out of the
horn.&nbsp; And when their discourse was unobstructed, Llevelys
told his brother that he would give him some insects, whereof he
should keep some to breed, lest by chance the like affliction
might come a second time.&nbsp; And other of these insects he
should take and bruise in water.&nbsp; And he assured him that it
would have <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>power to destroy the race of the
Coranians.&nbsp; That is to say, that when he came home to his
kingdom he should call together all the people both of his own
race and of the race of the Coranians for a conference, as though
with the intent of making peace between them; and that when they
were all together, he should take this charmed water, and cast it
over all alike.&nbsp; And he assured him that the water would
poison the race of the Coranians, but that it would not slay or
harm those of his own race.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p112.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p112.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;And the second plague,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is
in thy dominion, behold it is a dragon.&nbsp; And another dragon
of a foreign race is fighting with it, and striving to overcome
it.&nbsp; And therefore does your dragon make a fearful
outcry.&nbsp; And on this wise mayest thou come to know
this.&nbsp; After thou hast returned home, cause the Island to be
measured in <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>its length and breadth, and in the
place where thou dost find the exact central point, there cause a
pit to be dug, and cause a cauldron, full of the best mead that
can be made, to be put in the pit, with a covering of satin over
the face of the cauldron.&nbsp; And then, in thine own person do
thou remain there watching, and thou wilt see the dragons
fighting in the form of terrific animals.&nbsp; And at length
they will take the form of dragons in the air.&nbsp; And last of
all, after wearying themselves with fierce and furious fighting,
they will fall in the form of two pigs upon the covering, and
they will sink in, and the covering with them, and they will draw
it down to the very bottom of the cauldron.&nbsp; And they will
drink up the whole of the mead; and after that they will
sleep.&nbsp; Thereupon do thou immediately fold the covering
around them, and bury them in a kistvaen, in the strongest place
thou hast in thy dominions, and hide them in the earth.&nbsp; And
as long as they shall bide in that strong place, no plague shall
come to the Island of Britain from elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cause of the third plague,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is a mighty man of magic, who takes thy meat and thy drink
and thy store.&nbsp; And he through illusions and charms causes
every one to sleep.&nbsp; Therefore it is needful for thee in thy
own person to watch thy food and thy provisions.&nbsp; And lest
he should overcome thee with sleep, be there a cauldron of cold
water by thy side, and when thou art oppressed with sleep, plunge
into the cauldron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Lludd returned back unto his land.&nbsp; And immediately
he summoned to him the whole of his own race and of the
Coranians.&nbsp; And as Llevelys had taught him, he bruised the
insects in water, the <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>which he cast over them all
together, and forthwith it destroyed the whole tribe of the
Coranians, without hurt to any of the Britons.</p>
<p>And some time after this Lludd caused the Island to be
measured in its length and in its breadth.&nbsp; And in Oxford he
found the central point, and in that place he caused the earth to
be dug, and in that pit a cauldron to be set, full of the best
mead that could be made, and a covering of satin over the face of
it.&nbsp; And he himself watched that night.&nbsp; And while he
was there, he beheld the dragons fighting.&nbsp; And when they
were weary they fell, and came down upon the top of the satin,
and drew it with them to the bottom of the cauldron.&nbsp; And
when they had drunk the mead they slept.&nbsp; And in their
sleep, Lludd folded the covering around them, and in the securest
place he had in Snowdon, he hid them in a kistvaen.&nbsp; Now
after that this spot was called Dinas Emreis, but before that,
Dinas Ffaraon.&nbsp; And thus the fierce outcry ceased in his
dominions.</p>
<p>And when this was ended, King Lludd caused an exceeding great
banquet to be prepared.&nbsp; And when it was ready, he placed a
vessel of cold water by his side, and he in his own proper person
watched it.&nbsp; And as he abode thus clad with arms, about the
third watch of the night, lo! he heard many surpassing
fascinations and various songs.&nbsp; And drowsiness urged him to
sleep.&nbsp; Upon this, lest he should be hindered from his
purpose and be overcome by sleep, he went often into the
water.&nbsp; And at last, behold, a man of vast size, clad in
strong, heavy armour, came in, bearing a hamper.&nbsp; And, as he
was wont, he put all the food and provisions of meat and drink
into the hamper, and proceeded to go with it forth.&nbsp; And
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>nothing was ever more wonderful to Lludd, than that the
hamper should hold so much.</p>
<p>And thereupon King Lludd went after him and spoke unto him
thus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though thou
hast done many insults and much spoil erewhile, thou shalt not do
so any more, unless thy skill in arms and thy prowess be greater
than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p115.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p115.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Then he instantly put down the hamper on the floor, and
awaited him.&nbsp; And a fierce encounter was between them, so
that the glittering fire flew out from their arms.&nbsp; And at
the last Lludd grappled with him, and fate bestowed the victory
on Lludd.&nbsp; And he threw the plague to the earth.&nbsp; And
after he had <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>overcome him by strength and might,
he besought his mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can I grant thee
mercy,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;after all the many injuries
and wrongs that thou hast done me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All the
losses that ever I have caused thee,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
will make thee atonement for, equal to what I have taken.&nbsp;
And I will never do the like from this time forth.&nbsp; But thy
faithful vassal will I be.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the king accepted
this from him.</p>
<p>And thus Lludd freed the Island of Britain from the three
plagues.&nbsp; And from thenceforth until the end of his life, in
prosperous peace did Lludd the son of Beli rule the Island of
Britain.&nbsp; And this Tale is called the Story of Lludd and
Llevelys.&nbsp; And thus it ends.</p>

<p>In times past there lived in Penllyn a man of gentle lineage,
named Tegid Voel, and his dwelling was in the midst of the Lake
Tegid, and his wife was called Caridwen.&nbsp; And there was born
to him of his wife a <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>son named Morvran ab Tegid, and also
a daughter named Creirwy, the fairest maiden in the world was
she; and they had a brother the most ill-favoured man in the
world, Avagddu.&nbsp; Now Caridwen his mother thought that he was
not likely to be admitted among men of noble birth, by reason of
his ugliness, unless he had some exalted merits or
knowledge.&nbsp; For it was in the beginning of Arthur&rsquo;s
time and of the Round Table.</p>
<p>So she resolved, according to the arts of the books of the
Fferyllt, <a name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a> to boil a cauldron of Inspiration and
Science for her son, that his reception might be honourable
because of his knowledge of the mysteries of the future state of
the world.</p>
<p>Then she began to boil the cauldron, which from the beginning
of its boiling might not cease to boil for a year and a day,
until three blessed drops were obtained of the grace of
inspiration.</p>
<p>And she put Gwion Bach the son of Gwreang of Llanfair in
Caereinion, in Powys, to stir the cauldron, and a blind man named
Morda to kindle the fire beneath it, and she charged them that
they should not suffer it to cease boiling for the space of a
year and a day.&nbsp; And she herself, according to the books of
the astronomers, and in planetary hours, gathered every day of
all charm-bearing herbs.&nbsp; And one day, towards the end of
the year, as Caridwen was culling plants and making incantations,
it chanced that three drops of the charmed liquor flew out of the
cauldron and fell upon the finger of Gwion Bach.&nbsp; And by
reason of their great heat he put his finger to his mouth, <a
name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b"
class="citation">[118b]</a> and the instant he put those
marvel-working <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>drops into his mouth, he foresaw
everything that was to come, and perceived that his chief care
must be to guard against the wiles of Caridwen, for vast was her
skill.&nbsp; And in very great fear he fled towards his own
land.&nbsp; And the cauldron burst in two, because all the liquor
within it except the three charm-bearing drops was poisonous, so
that the horses of Gwyddno Garanhir were poisoned by the water of
the stream into which the liquor of the cauldron ran, and the
confluence of that stream was called the Poison of the Horses of
Gwyddno from that time forth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p119.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p119.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Thereupon came in Caridwen and saw all the toil of the whole
year lost.&nbsp; And she seized a billet of <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>wood and
struck the blind Morda on the head until one of his eyes fell out
upon his cheek.&nbsp; And he said, &ldquo;Wrongfully hast thou
disfigured me, for I am innocent.&nbsp; Thy loss was not because
of me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou speakest truth,&rdquo; said
Caridwen, &ldquo;it was Gwion Bach who robbed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went forth after him, running.&nbsp; And he saw her,
and changed himself into a hare and fled.&nbsp; But she changed
herself into a greyhound and turned him.&nbsp; And he ran towards
a river, and became a fish.&nbsp; And she in the form of an
otter-bitch chased him under the water, until he was fain to turn
himself into a bird of the air.&nbsp; Then she, as a hawk,
followed him and gave him no rest in the sky.&nbsp; And just as
she was about to stoop upon him, and he was in fear of death, he
espied a heap of winnowed wheat on the floor of a barn, and he
dropped amongst the wheat, and turned himself into one of the
grains.&nbsp; Then she transformed herself into a high-crested
black hen, and went to the wheat and scratched it with her feet,
and found him out and swallowed him.&nbsp; And, as the story
says, she bore him nine months, and when she was delivered of
him, she could not find it in her heart to kill him, by reason of
his beauty.&nbsp; So she wrapped him in a leathern bag, and cast
him into the sea to the mercy of God, on the twenty-ninth day of
April.</p>
<p>And at that time the weir of Gwyddno was on the strand between
Dyvi and Aberystwyth, near to his own castle, and the value of an
hundred pounds was taken in that weir every May eve.&nbsp; And in
those days Gwyddno had an only son named Elphin, the most hapless
of youths, and the most needy.&nbsp; And it grieved his father
sore, for he thought that he was <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>born in an
evil hour.&nbsp; And by the advice of his council, his father had
granted him the drawing of the weir that year, to see if good
luck would ever befall him, and to give him something wherewith
to begin the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p121.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p121.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And the next day, when Elphin went to look, there was nothing
in the weir.&nbsp; But as he turned back he perceived the
leathern bag upon a pole of the weir.&nbsp; Then said one of the
weir-ward unto Elphin, &ldquo;Thou wast never unlucky until
to-night, and now thou hast destroyed the virtues of the weir,
which always yielded the value of an hundred pounds every May
eve, and to-night there is nothing but this leathern skin within
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How now,&rdquo; said Elphin, &ldquo;there
may be therein the value of an hundred pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well!
they took up the leathern bag, and he who opened it saw the
forehead of the boy, and said to Elphin, &ldquo;Behold a radiant
brow!&rdquo; <a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121"
class="citation">[121]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Taliesin be he
called,&rdquo; said Elphin.&nbsp; And he lifted the boy in his
arms, and lamenting his mischance, he placed him sorrowfully <!--
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>behind him.&nbsp; And he made his horse amble gently,
that before had been trotting, and he carried him as softly as if
he had been sitting in the easiest chair in the world.&nbsp; And
presently the boy made a Consolation and praise to Elphin, and
foretold honour to Elphin; and the Consolation was as you may
see,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fair Elphin cease to lament!<br />
Let no one be dissatisfied with his own,<br />
To despair will bring no advantage.<br />
No man sees what supports him;<br />
The prayer of Cynllo will not be in vain;<br />
God will not violate his promise.<br />
Never in Gwyddno&rsquo;s weir<br />
Was there such good luck as this night.<br />
Fair Elphin, dry thy cheeks!<br />
Being too sad will not avail,<br />
Although thou thinkest thou hast no gain,<br />
Too much grief will bring thee no good;<br />
Nor doubt the miracles of the Almighty:<br />
Although I am but little, I am highly gifted.<br />
From seas, and from mountains,<br />
And from the depths of rivers,<br />
God brings wealth to the fortunate man.<br />
Elphin of lively qualities,<br />
Thy resolution is unmanly;<br />
Thou must not be over sorrowful:<br />
Better to trust in God than to forbode ill.<br />
Weak and small as I am,<br />
On the foaming beach of the ocean,<br />
In the day of trouble, I shall be<br />
Of more service to thee than 300 salmon.<br />
Elphin of notable qualities,<br />
Be not displeased at thy misfortune;<br />
Although reclined thus weak in my bag,<br />
There lies a virtue in my tongue.<br />
While I continue thy protector<br />
Thou hast not much to fear;<br />
Remembering the names of the Trinity,<br />
None shall be able to harm thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>And this was the first poem that Taliesin ever sang,
being to console Elphin in his grief for that the produce of the
weir was lost, and, what was worse, that all the world would
consider that it was through his fault and ill-luck.&nbsp; And
then Gwyddno Garanhir <a name="citation123"></a><a
href="#footnote123" class="citation">[123]</a> asked him what he
was, whether man or spirit.&nbsp; Whereupon he sang this tale,
and said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First, I have been formed a comely
person,<br />
In the court of Ceridwen I have done penance;<br />
Though little I was seen, placidly received,<br />
I was great on the floor of the place to where I was led;<br />
I have been a prized defence, the sweet muse the cause,<br />
And by law without speech I have been liberated<br />
By a smiling black old hag, when irritated<br />
Dreadful her claim when pursued:<br />
I have fled with vigour, I have fled as a frog,<br />
I have fled in the semblance of a crow, scarcely finding rest;<br
/>
I have fled vehemently, I have fled as a chain,<br />
I have fled as a roe into an entangled thicket;<br />
I have fled as a wolf cub, I have fled as a wolf in a
wilderness,<br />
I have fled as a thrush of portending language;<br />
I have fled as a fox, used to concurrent bounds of quirks;<br />
I have fled as a martin, which did not avail:<br />
I have fled as a squirrel, that vainly hides,<br />
I have fled as a stag&rsquo;s antler, of ruddy course,<br />
I have fled as iron in a glowing fire,<br />
I have fled as a spear-head, of woe to such as has a wish for
it;<br />
I have fled as a fierce bull bitterly fighting,<br />
I have fled as a bristly boar seen in a ravine,<br />
I have fled as a white grain of pure wheat,<br />
On the skirt of a hempen sheet entangled,<br />
That seemed of the size of a mare&rsquo;s foal,<br />
That is filling like a ship on the waters;<br />
Into a dark leathern bag I was thrown,<br />
And on a boundless sea I was sent adrift;<br />
Which was to me an omen of being tenderly nursed,<br />
And the Lord God then set me at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Then came Elphin to the house or court of Gwyddno his
father, and Taliesin with him.&nbsp; And Gwyddno asked him if he
had had a good haul at the weir, and he told him that he had got
that which was better than fish.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was
that?&rdquo; said Gwyddno.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Bard,&rdquo; answered
Elphin.&nbsp; Then said Gwyddno, &ldquo;Alas, what will he profit
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Taliesin himself replied and said,
&ldquo;He will profit him more than the weir ever profited
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Asked Gwyddno, &ldquo;Art thou able to speak,
and thou so little?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Taliesin answered him,
&ldquo;I am better able to speak than thou to question
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me hear what thou canst say,&rdquo;
quoth Gwyddno.&nbsp; Then Taliesin sang,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In water there is a quality endowed with a
blessing;<br />
On God it is most just to meditate aright;<br />
To God it is proper to supplicate with seriousness,<br />
Since no obstacle can there be to obtain a reward from him.<br />
Three times have I been born, I know by meditation;<br />
It were miserable for a person not to come and obtain<br />
All the sciences of the world, collected together in my
breast,<br />
For I know what has been, what in future will occur.<br />
I will supplicate my Lord that I get refuge in him,<br />
A regard I may obtain in his grace;<br />
The Son of Mary is my trust, great in Him is my delight,<br />
For in Him is the world continually upholden.<br />
God has been to instruct me and to raise my expectation,<br />
The true Creator of heaven, who affords me protection;<br />
It is rightly intended that the saints should daily pray,<br />
For God, the renovator, will bring them to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And forthwith Elphin gave his haul to his wife, and she nursed
him tenderly and lovingly.&nbsp; Thenceforward Elphin increased
in riches more and more day after day, and in love and favour
with the king, and there abode Taliesin until he was thirteen
years old, when Elphin son of Gwyddno went by a <!-- page
125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Christmas invitation to his uncle, Maelgwn Gwynedd, who
sometime after this held open court at Christmas-tide in the
castle of Dyganwy, for all the number of his lords of both
degrees, both spiritual and temporal, with a vast and thronged
host of knights and squires.&nbsp; And amongst them there arose a
discourse and discussion.&nbsp; And thus was it said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there in the whole world a king so great as Maelgwn,
or one on whom Heaven has bestowed so many spiritual gifts as
upon him?&nbsp; First, form, and beauty, and meekness, and
strength, besides all the powers of the soul?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
together with these they said that Heaven had given one gift that
exceeded all the others, which was the beauty, and comeliness,
and grace, and wisdom, and modesty of his queen; whose virtues
surpassed those of all the ladies and noble maidens throughout
the whole kingdom.&nbsp; And with this they put questions one to
another amongst themselves, Who had braver men?&nbsp; Who had
fairer or swifter horses or greyhounds?&nbsp; Who had more
skilful or wiser bards&mdash;than Maelgwn?</p>
<p>Now at that time the bards were in great favour with the
exalted of the kingdom; and then none performed the office of
those who are now called heralds, unless they were learned men,
not only expert in the service of kings and princes, but studious
and well versed in the lineage, and arms, and exploits of princes
and kings, and in discussions concerning foreign kingdoms, and
the ancient things of this kingdom, and chiefly in the annals of
the first nobles; and also were prepared always with their
answers in various languages, Latin, French, Welsh, and
English.&nbsp; And together with this they were great
chroniclers, and recorders, and skilful in framing <!-- page
126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>verses, and ready in making englyns in every one of
these languages.&nbsp; Now of these there were at that feast
within the palace of Maelgwn as many as four and twenty, and
chief of them all, was one named Heinin Vardd.</p>
<p>When they had all made an end of thus praising the king and
his gifts, it befell that Elphin spoke on this wise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of a truth none but a king may vie with a king; but were
he not a king, I would say that my wife was as virtuous as any
lady in the kingdom, and also that I have a bard who is more
skilful than all the king&rsquo;s bards.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a short
space some of his fellows showed the king all the boastings of
Elphin; and the king ordered him to be thrown into a strong
prison, until he might know the truth as to the virtues of his
wife, and the wisdom of his bard.</p>
<p>Now when Elphin had been put in a tower of the castle, with a
thick chain about his feet, (it is said that it was a silver
chain, because he was of royal blood;) the king, as the story
relates, sent his son Rhun to enquire into the demeanour of
Elphin&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Now Rhun was the most graceless man in
the world, and there was neither wife nor maiden with whom he had
held converse, but was evil spoken of.&nbsp; While Rhun went in
haste towards Elphin&rsquo;s dwelling, being fully minded to
bring disgrace upon his wife, Taliesin told his mistress how that
the king had placed his master in durance in prison, and how that
Rhun was coming in haste to strive to bring disgrace upon
her.&nbsp; Wherefore he caused his mistress to array one of the
maids of her kitchen in her apparel; which the noble lady gladly
did; and she loaded her hands with the best rings that she and
her husband possessed.</p>
<p>In this guise Taliesin caused his mistress to put the <!--
page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>maiden to sit at the board in her room at supper, and
he made her to seem as her mistress, and the mistress to seem as
the maid.&nbsp; And when they were in due time seated at their
supper in the manner that has been said, Rhun suddenly arrived at
Elphin&rsquo;s dwelling, and was received with joy, for all the
servants knew him plainly; and they brought him in haste to the
room of their mistress, in the semblance of whom the maid rose up
from supper and welcomed him gladly.&nbsp; And afterwards she sat
down to supper again the second time, and Rhun with her.&nbsp;
Then Rhun began jesting with the maid, who still kept the
semblance of her mistress.&nbsp; And verily this story shows that
the maiden became so intoxicated, that she fell asleep; and the
story relates that it was a powder that Rhun put into the drink,
that made her sleep so soundly that she never felt it when he cut
from off her hand her little finger, whereon was the signet ring
of Elphin, which he had sent to his wife as a token, a short time
before.&nbsp; And Rhun returned to the king with the finger and
the ring as a proof, to show that he had cut it from off her
hand, without her awaking from her sleep of intemperance.</p>
<p>The king rejoiced greatly at these tidings, and he sent for
his councillors, to whom he told the whole story from the
beginning.&nbsp; And he caused Elphin to be brought out of his
prison, and he chided him because of his boast.&nbsp; And he
spake unto Elphin on this wise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Elphin, be it known
to thee beyond a doubt that it is but folly for a man to trust in
the virtues of his wife further than he can see her; and that
thou mayest be certain of thy wife&rsquo;s vileness, behold her
finger, with thy signet ring upon it, which was cut from her hand
last night, while she slept the <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>sleep of
intoxication.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then thus spake Elphin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With thy leave, mighty king, I cannot deny my ring, for it
is known of many; but verily I assert strongly that the finger
around which it is, was never attached to the hand of my wife,
for in truth and certainty there are three notable things
pertaining to it, none of which ever belonged to any of my
wife&rsquo;s fingers.&nbsp; The first of the three is, that it is
certain, by your grace&rsquo;s leave, that wheresoever my wife is
at this present hour, whether sitting, or standing, or lying
down, this ring would never remain upon her thumb, whereas you
can plainly see that it was hard to draw it over the joint of the
little finger of the hand whence this was cut; the second thing
is, that my wife has never let pass one Saturday since I have
known her without paring her nails before going to bed, and you
can see fully that the nail of this little finger has not been
pared for a month.&nbsp; The third is, truly, that the hand
whence this finger came was kneading rye dough within three days
before the finger was cut therefrom, and I can assure your
goodness that my wife has never kneaded rye dough since my wife
she has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king was mightily wrath with Elphin for so stoutly
withstanding him, respecting the goodness of his wife, wherefore
he ordered him to his prison a second time, saying that he should
not be loosed thence until he had proved the truth of his boast,
as well concerning the wisdom of his bard as the virtues of his
wife.</p>
<p>In the meantime his wife and Taliesin remained joyful at
Elphin&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; And Taliesin shewed his mistress
how that Elphin was in prison because of them, but he bade her be
glad for that he would go <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>to
Maelgwn&rsquo;s court to free his master.&nbsp; Then she asked
him in what manner he would set him free.&nbsp; And he answered
her,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A journey will I perform,<br />
And to the gate I will come;<br />
The hall I will enter,<br />
And my song I will sing;<br />
My speech I will pronounce<br />
To silence royal bards.<br />
In presence of their chief,<br />
I will greet to deride,<br />
Upon them I will break<br />
And Elphin I will free.<br />
Should contention arise,<br />
In presence of the prince,<br />
With summons to the bards<br />
For the sweet flowing song,<br />
And wizards&rsquo; posing lore<br />
And wisdom of Druids.<br />
In the court of the sons of the distributor<br />
Some are who did appear<br />
Intent on wily schemes,<br />
By craft and tricking means,<br />
In pangs of affliction<br />
To wrong the innocent,<br />
Let the fools be silent,<br />
As erst in Badon&rsquo;s fight,&mdash;<br />
With Arthur of liberal ones<br />
The head, with long red blades;<br />
Through feats of testy men,<br />
And a chief with his foes.<br />
Woe be to them, the fools,<br />
When revenge comes on them.<br />
I Taliesin, chief of bards,<br />
With a sapient druid&rsquo;s words,<br />
Will set kind Elphin free<br />
From haughty tyrant&rsquo;s bonds.<br />
To their fell and chilling cry,<br />
By the act of a surprising steed,<br />
From the far distant North,<br />
There soon shall be an end.<br />
<!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Let neither grace nor health<br />
Be to Maelgwn Gwynedd,<br />
For this force and this wrong;<br />
And be extremes of ills<br />
And an avenged end<br />
To Rhun and all his race:<br />
Short be his course of life,<br />
Be all his lands laid waste;<br />
And long exile be assigned<br />
To Maelgwn Gwynedd!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this he took leave of his mistress, and came at last to
the court of Maelgwn, who was going to sit in his hall and dine
in his royal state, as it was the custom in those days for kings
and princes to do at every chief feast.&nbsp; And as soon as
Taliesin entered the hall, he placed himself in a quiet corner,
near the place where the bards and the minstrels were wont to
come to in doing their service and duty to the king, as is the
custom at the high festivals when the bounty is proclaimed.&nbsp;
And so, when the bards and the heralds came to cry largess and to
proclaim the power of the king and his strength, at the moment
that they passed by the corner wherein he was crouching, Taliesin
pouted out his lips after them, and played &ldquo;Blerwm,
blerwm,&rdquo; with his finger upon his lips.&nbsp; Neither took
they much notice of him as they went by, but proceeded forward
till they came before the king, unto whom they made their
obeisance with their bodies, as they were wont, without speaking
a single word, but pouting out their lips, and making mouths at
the king, playing &ldquo;Blerwm, blerwm,&rdquo; upon their lips
with their fingers, as they had seen the boy do elsewhere.&nbsp;
This sight caused the king to wonder and to deem within himself
that they were drunk with many liquors.&nbsp; Wherefore he
commanded one of his <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>lords, who served at the board, to
go to them and desire them to collect their wits, and to consider
where they stood, and what it was fitting for them to do.&nbsp;
And this lord did so gladly.&nbsp; But they ceased not from their
folly any more than before.&nbsp; Whereupon he sent to them a
second time, and a third, desiring them to go forth from the
hall.&nbsp; At the last the king ordered one of his squires to
give a blow to the chief of them named Heinin Vardd; and the
squire took a broom, and struck him on the head, so that he fell
back in his seat.&nbsp; Then he arose and went on his knees, and
besought leave of the king&rsquo;s grace to show that this their
fault was not through want of knowledge, neither through
drunkenness, but by the influence of some spirit that was in the
hall.&nbsp; And after this Heinin spoke on this wise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh honourable king, be it known to your grace, that not
from the strength of drink, or of too much liquor, are we dumb,
without power of speech like drunken men, but through the
influence of a spirit that sits in the corner yonder in the form
of a child.&rdquo;&nbsp; Forthwith the king commanded the squire
to fetch him; and he went to the nook where Taliesin sat, and
brought him before the king, who asked him what he was, and
whence he came.&nbsp; And he answered the king in verse.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Primary chief bard am I
to Elphin,<br />
And my original country is the region of the summer stars;<br />
Idno and Heinin called me Merddin,<br />
At length every king will call me Taliesin.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And when the king and his nobles had heard the song, they
wondered much, for they had never heard the like from a boy so
young as he.&nbsp; And when the king knew that he was the bard of
Elphin, he bade <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Heinin, his first and wisest bard,
to answer Taliesin and to strive with him.&nbsp; But when he
came, he could do no other, but play &ldquo;blerwm&rdquo; on his
lips; and when he sent for the others of the four and twenty
bards, they all did likewise, and could do no other.&nbsp; And
Maelgwn asked the boy Taliesin what was his errand, and he
answered him in song.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Puny bards, I am trying<br />

<p>And while he was thus singing his verse near the door there
arose a mighty storm of wind, so that the king and all his nobles
thought that the castle would fall upon their heads.&nbsp; And
the king caused them to fetch Elphin in haste from his dungeon,
and placed him before Taliesin.&nbsp; And it is said that
immediately he sang a verse, so that the chains opened from about
his feet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I adore the Supreme, Lord of all
animation,&mdash;<br />
Him that supports the heaven, Ruler of every extreme,<br />
Him that made the water good for all,<br />
Him who has bestowed each gift, and blesses it;&mdash;<br />
May abundance of mead be given Maelgwn of Anglesey, who supplies
us,<br />
From his foaming meadhorns, with the choicest pure liquor.<br />
Since bees collect, and do not enjoy,<br />
We have sparkling distilled mead, which is universally
praised.<br />
The multitude of creatures which the earth nourishes,<br />
God made for man, with a view to enrich him;&mdash;<br />
Some are violent, some are mute, he enjoys them,<br />
Some are wild, some are tame; the Lord makes them;&mdash;<br />
Part of their produce becomes clothing;<br />
For food and beverage till doom will they continue.<br />
I entreat the Supreme, Sovereign of the region of peace,<br />
To liberate Elphin from banishment,<br />
The man who gave me wine, and ale, and mead,<br />
With large princely steeds, of beautiful appearance;<br />
May he yet give me; and at the end,<br />
May God of His good will grant me, in honour,<br />
A succession of numberless ages, in the retreat of
tranquillity.&mdash;<br />
Elphin, knight of mead, late be thy dissolution!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>And afterwards he sang the ode which is called
&ldquo;The Excellence of the Bards.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What was the first man<br />
Made by the God of heaven;<br />
What the fairest flattering speech<br />
That was prepared by Ieuav;<br />
What meat, what drink,<br />
What roof his shelter;<br />
What the first impression<br />
Of his primary thinking;<br />
What became his clothing;<br />
Who carried on a disguise,<br />
Owing to the wiles of the country,<br />
In the beginning?<br />
Wherefore should a stone be hard;<br />
Why should a thorn be sharp-pointed;<br />
Who is hard like a flint;<br />
Who is salt like brine;<br />
Who sweet like honey;<br />
Who rides on the gale;</p>
<p>Why ridged should be the nose;<br />
Why should a wheel be round;<br />
Why should the tongue be gifted with speech<br />
Rather than another member?<br />
If thy bards, Heinin, be competent,<br />
Let them reply to me, Taliesin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And after that he sang the address which is called &ldquo;The
Reproof of the Bards.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If thou art a bard completely imbued<br />
With genius not to be controlled,<br />
Be thou not untractable<br />
Within the court of thy king;<br />
Until thy rigmarole shall be known,<br />
Be thou silent Heinin<br />
As to the name of thy verse,<br />
And the name of thy vaunting;<br />
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>And as to the name of thy grandsire<br />
Prior to his being baptized.<br />
And the name of the sphere,<br />
And the name of the element,<br />
And the name of thy language,<br />
And the name of thy region.<br />
Avaunt, ye bards above,<br />
Avaunt, ye bards below!<br />
My beloved is below,<br />
In the fetter of Arianrod.<br />
It is certain you know not<br />
How to understand the song I utter,<br />
Nor clearly how to discriminate<br />
Between the truth and what is false;<br />
Puny bards, crows of the district,<br />
Why do you not take to flight?<br />
A bard that will not silence me,<br />
Silence may he not obtain,<br />
Till he goes to be covered<br />
Under gravel and pebbles;<br />
Such as shall listen to me,<br />
May God listen to him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then sang he the piece called &ldquo;The Spite of the
Bards.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Minstrels persevere in their false
custom,<br />
Immoral ditties are their delight;<br />
Vain and tasteless praise they recite;<br />
Falsehood at all times do they utter;<br />
The innocent persons they ridicule;<br />
Married women they destroy,<br />
Innocent virgins of Mary they corrupt;<br />
As they pass their lives away in vanity;<br />
Poor innocent persons they ridicule;<br />
At night they get drunk, they sleep the day;<br />
In idleness without work they feed themselves;<br />
The Church they hate, and the tavern they frequent;<br />
With thieves and perjured fellows they associate;<br />
At courts they inquire after feasts;<br />
Every senseless word they bring forward;<br />
Every deadly sin they praise;<br />
<!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>Every vile course of life they lead;<br />
Through every village, town, and country they stroll;<br />
Concerning the gripe of death they think not;<br />
Neither lodging nor charity do they give;<br />
Indulging in victuals to excess.<br />
Psalms or prayers they do not use,<br />
Tithes or offerings to God they do not pay,<br />
On holidays or Sundays they do not worship;<br />
Vigils or festivals they do not heed.<br />
The birds do fly, the fish do swim,<br />
The bees collect honey, worms do crawl,<br />
Every thing travails to obtain its food,<br />
Except minstrels and lazy useless thieves.</p>
<p>I deride neither song nor minstrelsy,<br />
For they are given by God to lighten thought;<br />
But him who abuses them,<br />
For blaspheming Jesus and his service.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taliesin having set his master free from prison, and having
protected the innocence of his wife, and silenced the Bards so
that not one of them dared to say a word, now brought
Elphin&rsquo;s wife before them, and shewed that she had not one
finger wanting.&nbsp; Right glad was Elphin, right glad was
Taliesin.</p>
<p>Then he bade Elphin wager the king, that he had a horse both
better and swifter than the king&rsquo;s horses.&nbsp; And this
Elphin did, and the day, and the time, and the place were fixed,
and the place was that which at this day is called Morva
Rhiannedd; and thither the king went with all his people, and
four and twenty of the swiftest horses he possessed.&nbsp; And
after a long process the course was marked, and the horses were
placed for running.&nbsp; Then came Taliesin with four and twenty
twigs of holly, which he had burnt black, and he caused the youth
who was to ride his master&rsquo;s horse to place them in his
belt, and he gave <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>him orders to let all the
king&rsquo;s horses get before him, and as he should overtake one
horse after the other, to take one of the twigs and strike the
horse with it over the crupper, and then let that twig fall; and
after that to take another twig, and do in like manner to every
one of the horses, as he should overtake them, enjoining the
horseman strictly to watch when his own horse should stumble, and
to throw down his cap on the spot.&nbsp; All these things did the
youth fulfil, giving a blow to every one of the king&rsquo;s
horses, and throwing down his cap on the spot where his horse
stumbled.&nbsp; And to this spot Taliesin brought his master
after his horse had won the race.&nbsp; And he caused Elphin to
put workmen to dig a hole there; and when they had dug the ground
deep enough, they found a large cauldron full of gold.&nbsp; And
then said Taliesin, &ldquo;Elphin, behold a payment and reward
unto thee, for having taken me out of the weir, and for having
reared me from that time until now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on this spot
stands a pool of water, which is to this time called
Pwllbair.</p>
<p>After all this, the king caused Taliesin to be brought before
him, and he asked him to recite concerning the creation of man
from the beginning; and thereupon he made the poem which is now
called &ldquo;One of the Four Pillars of Song.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Almighty made,<br />
Down the Hebron vale,<br />
With his plastic hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam&rsquo;s fair form;</p>
<p>And five hundred years,<br />
Void of any help,<br />
There he remained and lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a soul.</p>
<p>He again did form,<br />
In calm paradise,<br />
From a left-side rib,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bliss-throbbing Eve.</p>
<p>Seven hours they were<br />
The orchard keeping,<br />
Till Satan brought strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With wiles from hell.</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Thence were they driven,<br />
Cold and shivering,<br />
To gain their living,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into this world.</p>
<p>To bring forth with pain<br />
Their sons and daughters,<br />
To have possession<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Asia&rsquo;s land.</p>
<p>Twice five, ten and eight,<br />
She was self-bearing,<br />
The mixed burden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of man-woman.</p>
<p>And once, not hidden,<br />
She brought forth Abel,<br />
And Cain the forlorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The homicide.</p>
<p>To him and his mate<br />
Was given a spade,<br />
To break up the soil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus to get bread.</p>
<p>The wheat pure and white,<br />
Summer tilth to sow,<br />
Every man to feed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till great yule feast.</p>
<p>An angelic hand<br />
From the high Father,<br />
Brought seed for growing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Eve might sow;</p>
<p>But she then did hide<br />
Of the gift a tenth,<br />
And all did not sow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of what was dug.</p>
<p>Black rye then was found,<br />
And not pure wheat grain,<br />
To show the mischief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus of thieving.</p>
<p>For this thievish act,<br />
It is requisite,<br />
That all men should pay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tithe unto God.</p>
<p>Of the ruddy wine,<br />
Planted on sunny days,<br />
And on new moon nights;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the white wine.</p>
<p>The wheat rich in grain<br />
And red flowing wine<br />
Christ&rsquo;s pure body make,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Son of Alpha.</p>
<p>The wafer is flesh,<br />
The wine is spilt blood,<br />
The Trinity&rsquo;s words<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanctify them.</p>
<p>The concealed books<br />
From Emmanuel&rsquo;s hand<br />
Were brought by Raphael<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As Adam&rsquo;s gift.</p>
<p>When in his old age,<br />
To his chin immersed<br />
In Jordan&rsquo;s water,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping a fast,</p>
<p>Moses did obtain,<br />
In Jordan&rsquo;s water,<br />
The aid of the three<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most special rods.</p>
<p>Solomon did obtain,<br />
In Babel&rsquo;s tower,<br />
All the sciences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Asia land.</p>
<p>So did I obtain,<br />
In my bardic books,<br />
All the sciences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Europe and Africa.</p>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Their permitted way,<br />
And their fate I know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the end.</p>
<p>Oh! what misery,<br />
Through extreme of woe,<br />
Prophecy will show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Troia&rsquo;s race!</p>
<p>A coiling serpent,<br />
Proud and merciless,<br />
On her golden wings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Germany.</p>
<p>She will overrun<br />
England and Scotland,<br />
From Lychlyn sea-shore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Severn.</p>
<p>Then will the Brython<br />
Be as prisoners,<br />
By strangers swayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Saxony.</p>
<p>Their Lord they will praise,<br />
Their speech they will keep,<br />
Their land they will lose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Except wild Walia.</p>
<p>Till some change shall come,<br />
After long penance,<br />
When equally rife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The two crimes come.</p>
<p>Britons then shall have<br />
Their land and their crown,<br />
And the strangers swarm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall disappear.</p>
<p>All the angel&rsquo;s words,<br />
As to peace and war,<br />
Will be fulfilled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Britain&rsquo;s race.</p>
