			<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">My dear <span epub:type="z3998:recipient">Children</span>,</p>
<p>Infants as you yet are, I feel that I cannot dedicate more
fitly than to you these venerable relics of ancient lore, and I
do so in the hope of inciting you to cultivate the Literature of
“Gwyllt Walia,” in whose beautiful language you are
being initiated, and amongst whose free mountains you were
born.</p>
<p>May you become early imbued with the chivalric and exalted
sense of honour, and the fervent patriotism for which its sons
have ever been celebrated.</p>
<p>May you learn to emulate the noble qualities of Ivor Hael, and
the firm attachment to your Native Country, which distinguished
that Ivor Bach, after whom the elder of you was named.</p>
