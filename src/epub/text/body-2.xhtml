5</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>In this second volume, as in the first, I have given Lady
Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s translation exactly as she wrote
it.&nbsp; It would have been easy to make it a more faithful
reproduction of the Welsh by occasionally changing a word, or by
making a phrase more simple in diction.&nbsp; But the reader
would not have forgiven me for placing before him a translation
that was not Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I have again
ventured, however, after a careful comparison of the translation
with the original, to put in the form of footnotes a more
accurate or more literal rendering of passages which Lady
Charlotte Guest did not read aright, passages which she has
omitted, and passages the real meaning of which she seems to me
to have failed to grasp.</p>
<p>The first two tales in this volume make up, with &ldquo;The
Dream of Rhonabwy,&rdquo; the second volume of the original
edition.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Dream of Rhonabwy&rdquo; was placed in
my first volume, with &ldquo;The Lady of <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the
Fountain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peredur&rdquo;&mdash;the two tales
that form the first volume of the original edition.&nbsp; The
oldest of the tales&mdash;the Mabinogion proper&mdash;will all be
included in the third volume.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Arthur was accustomed to hold his Court at Caerlleon upon
Usk.&nbsp; And there he held it seven Easters, <a
name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a> and five Christmases.&nbsp; And once
upon a time he held his Court there at Whitsuntide.&nbsp; For
Caerlleon was the place most easy of access in his dominions,
both by sea and by land.&nbsp; And there were assembled <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a> nine crowned kings, who were his <!--
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>tributaries, and likewise earls and barons.&nbsp; For
they were his invited guests at all the high festivals, unless
they were prevented by any great hindrance.&nbsp; And when he was
at Caerlleon, holding his Court, thirteen churches were set apart
for mass.&nbsp; And thus were they appointed: one church for
Arthur, and his kings, and his guests; and the second for
Gwenhwyvar and her ladies; and the third for the Steward of the
Household and the Suitors; and the fourth for the Franks, and the
other officers; and the other nine churches were for the nine
Masters of the Household, and chiefly for Gwalchmai; for he, from
the eminence of his warlike fame, and from the nobleness of his
birth, was the most exalted of the nine.&nbsp; And there was no
other arrangement respecting the churches than that which we have
mentioned above.</p>
<p>Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr was the chief porter; but he did not
himself perform the office, except at one of the three high
festivals, for he had seven men to serve him; and they divided
the year amongst them.&nbsp; They were Grynn, and Pen Pighon, and
Llaes Cymyn, and Gogyfwlch, and Gwrdnei with Cat&rsquo;s eyes,
who could see as well by night as by day, and Drem the son of
Dremhitid, and Clust the son of Clustveinyd; and these were
Arthur&rsquo;s guards.&nbsp; And on Whit Tuesday, as the King sat
at the banquet, lo! there entered a tall, fair-headed youth, clad
in a coat and a surcoat of diapred satin, and a golden-hilted
sword about his neck, and low shoes of leather upon his
feet.&nbsp; And he came, and stood before Arthur.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hail to thee, Lord!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven
prosper thee,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and be thou
welcome.&nbsp; Dost thou bring any new tidings?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do, Lord,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know thee
not,&rdquo; said Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>marvel to me
that thou dost not know me.&nbsp; I am one of thy foresters,
Lord, in the Forest of Dean, and my name is Madawc, the son of
Twrgadarn.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me thine errand,&rdquo; said
Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so, Lord,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the Forest I saw a stag, the like of which beheld I
never yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is there about him,&rdquo;
asked Arthur, &ldquo;that thou never yet didst see his
like?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is of pure white, Lord, and he does
not herd with any other animal through stateliness and pride, so
royal is his bearing.&nbsp; And I come to seek thy counsel, Lord,
and to know thy will concerning him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems
best to me,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;to go and hunt him
to-morrow at break of day; and to cause general notice thereof to
be given to-night in all quarters of the Court.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
Arryfuerys was Arthur&rsquo;s chief huntsman, and Arelivri was
his chief page.&nbsp; And all received notice; and thus it was
arranged.&nbsp; And they sent the youth before them.&nbsp; Then
Gwenhwyvar said to Arthur, &ldquo;Wilt thou permit me,
Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to go to-morrow to see and hear the
hunt of the stag of which the young man spoke?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will, gladly,&rdquo; said Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then will
I go,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; And Gwalchmai said to Arthur,
&ldquo;Lord, if it seem well to thee, permit that into whose hunt
soever the stag shall come, that one, be he a knight or one on
foot, may cut off his head, and give it to whom he pleases,
whether to his own ladylove, or to the lady of his
friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I grant it gladly,&rdquo; said
Arthur, &ldquo;and let the Steward of the Household be chastised
if all are not ready to-morrow for the chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they passed the night with songs, and diversions, and
discourse, and ample entertainment.&nbsp; And when it was time
for them all to go to sleep, they went.&nbsp; And when the next
day came, they arose; <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and Arthur called the attendants, who
guarded his couch.&nbsp; And these were four pages, whose names
were Cadyrnerth the son of Porthawr Gandwy, and Ambreu the son of
Bedwor, and Amhar, the son of Arthur, and Goreu the son of
Custennin.&nbsp; And these men came to Arthur, and saluted him,
and arrayed him in his garments.&nbsp; And Arthur wondered that
Gwenhwyvar did not awake, and did not move in her bed: and the
attendants wished to awaken her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Disturb her
not,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;for she had rather sleep than go
to see the hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Arthur went forth, and he heard two horns sounding, one
from near the lodging of the chief huntsman, and the other from
near that of the chief page.&nbsp; And the whole assembly of the
multitudes came to Arthur, and they took the road to the
Forest.</p>
<p>And after Arthur had gone forth from the palace, Gwenhwyvar
awoke, and called to her maidens, and apparelled herself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Maidens,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I had leave last night to
go and see the hunt.&nbsp; Go one of you to the stable, and order
hither a horse such as a woman may ride.&rdquo;&nbsp; And one of
them went, and she found but two horses in the stable, and
Gwenhwyvar and one of her maidens mounted them, and went through
the Usk, and followed the track of the men and the horses.&nbsp;
And as they rode thus, they heard a loud and rushing sound; and
they looked behind them, and beheld a knight upon a <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> hunter foal of mighty size; and the
rider was a fair haired youth, bare-legged, and of princely mien,
and a golden-hilted sword was at his side, and a robe and a
surcoat of satin were upon him, and two low shoes of leather upon
his feet; and around him was a scarf of blue <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>purple, at
each corner of which was a golden apple.&nbsp; And his horse
stepped stately, and swift, and proud; and he overtook
Gwenhwyvar, and saluted her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven prosper thee,
Geraint,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I knew thee when first I saw
thee just now.&nbsp; And the welcome of heaven be unto
thee.&nbsp; And why didst thou not go with thy Lord to
hunt?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I knew not when he went,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I marvel too,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how
he could go unknown to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed,
lady,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was fast asleep, and knew
not when he went; but thou, O young man, art the most agreeable
companion I could have in the whole kingdom; and it may be that I
shall be more amused with the hunting than they; <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> for we shall hear the horns when they
sound, and we shall hear the dogs when they are let loose, and
begin to cry.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they went to the edge of the
Forest, and there they stood.&nbsp; &ldquo;From this
place,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we shall hear when the dogs are
let loose.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon they heard a loud noise,
and they looked towards the spot whence it came, and they beheld
a dwarf riding upon a horse, stately, and foaming, and prancing,
and strong, and spirited.&nbsp; And in the hand of the dwarf was
a whip.&nbsp; And near the dwarf they saw a lady upon a beautiful
white horse, of steady and stately pace; and she was clothed in a
garment of gold brocade.&nbsp; And near her was a knight upon a
war-horse of large size, with heavy and bright armour both upon
himself and upon his horse.&nbsp; And truly they never before saw
a knight, or a horse, or armour, of such remarkable size.&nbsp;
And they were all near to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geraint,&rdquo; said Gwenhwyvar, &ldquo;knowest thou
the <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>name of that tall knight yonder?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know him not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the strange armour that
he wears prevents my either seeing his face or his
features.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, maiden,&rdquo; said Gwenhwyvar,
&ldquo;and ask the dwarf who that knight is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
the maiden went up to the dwarf; and the dwarf waited for the
maiden, when he saw her coming towards him.&nbsp; And the maiden
enquired of the dwarf who the knight was.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not
tell thee,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since thou art so
churlish as not to tell me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will ask
him himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shall not ask him, by my
faith,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because thou art not of honour sufficient to
befit thee to speak to my Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the maiden
turned her horse&rsquo;s head towards the knight, upon which the
dwarf struck her with the whip that was in his hand across the
face and the eyes, until the blood flowed forth.&nbsp; And the
maiden, through the hurt she received from the blow, returned to
Gwenhwyvar, complaining of the pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very rudely has
the dwarf treated thee,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
go myself to know who the knight is.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said Gwenhwyvar.&nbsp; And Geraint went up to
the dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is yonder knight?&rdquo; said
Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not tell thee,&rdquo; said the
dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then will I ask him himself,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;That wilt thou not, by my faith,&rdquo; said the
dwarf; &ldquo;thou art not honourable enough to speak with my
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Geraint, &ldquo;I have spoken with men of
equal rank with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned his horse&rsquo;s
head towards the knight, but the dwarf overtook him and struck
him as he had done the maiden, so that the blood coloured the
scarf that Geraint wore.&nbsp; Then Geraint put his hand upon the
hilt of his sword, but he took counsel with himself, and
considered that it would be no vengeance for him to slay the
dwarf, <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and to be attacked unarmed by the
armed knight, so he returned to where Gwenhwyvar was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast acted wisely and discreetly,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will follow him
yet, with thy permission; and at last he will come to some
inhabited place, where I may have arms either as a loan or for a
pledge, so that I may encounter the knight.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and do not attack him until
thou hast good arms, and I shall be very anxious concerning thee,
until I hear tidings of thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I am
alive,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou shall hear tidings of me by
to-morrow afternoon;&rdquo; and with that he departed.</p>
<p>And the road they took was below the palace of Caerlleon, and
across the ford of the Usk; and they went along a fair, and even,
and lofty ridge of ground, until they came to a town, and at the
extremity of the town they saw a Fortress and a Castle.&nbsp; And
they came to the extremity of the town.&nbsp; And as the knight
passed through it, all the people arose, and saluted him, and
bade him welcome.&nbsp; And when Geraint came into the town, he
looked at every house, to see if he knew any of those whom he
saw.&nbsp; But he knew none, and none knew him to do him the
kindness to let him have arms either as a loan or for a
pledge.&nbsp; And every house he saw was full of men, and arms,
and horses.&nbsp; And they were polishing shields, and burnishing
swords, and washing armour, and shoeing horses.&nbsp; And the
knight, and the lady, and the dwarf, rode up to the Castle that
was in the town, and every one was glad in the Castle.&nbsp; And
from the battlements and the gates they risked their necks,
through their eagerness to greet them, and to show their joy.</p>
<p>Geraint stood there to see whether the knight <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>would
remain in the Castle; and when he was certain that he would do
so, he looked around him; and at a little distance from the town
he saw an old palace in ruins, wherein was a hall that was
falling to decay.&nbsp; And as he knew not any one in the town,
he went towards the old palace; and when he came near to the
palace, he saw but one chamber, and a bridge of marble-stone
leading to it.&nbsp; And upon the bridge he saw sitting a
hoary-headed man, upon whom were tattered garments.&nbsp; And
Geraint gazed steadfastly upon him for a long time.&nbsp; Then
the hoary-headed man spoke to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;wherefore art thou thoughtful?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am thoughtful,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because I know not
where to go to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou come forward
this way, chieftain?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and thou shalt have
of the best that can be procured for thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
Geraint went forward.&nbsp; And the hoary-headed man preceded him
into the hall.&nbsp; And in the hall he dismounted, and he left
there his horse.&nbsp; Then he went on to the upper chamber with
the hoary-headed man.&nbsp; And in the chamber he beheld an old
decrepit woman, sitting on a cushion, with old tattered garments
of satin upon her; and it seemed to him that he had never seen a
woman fairer than she must have been when in the fulness of
youth.&nbsp; And beside her was a maiden, upon whom were a vest
and a veil, that were old, and beginning to be worn out.&nbsp;
And truly he never saw a maiden more full of comeliness, and
grace, and beauty, than she.&nbsp; And the hoary-headed man said
to the maiden, &ldquo;There is no attendant for the horse of this
youth but thyself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will render the best
service I am able,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;both to him and to his
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the maiden disarrayed the youth, and then
she furnished his horse with straw and with corn.&nbsp; And <!--
page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>she went to the hall as before, and then she returned to
the chamber.&nbsp; And the hoary-headed man said to the maiden,
&ldquo;Go to the town,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and bring hither
the best that thou canst find both of food and of
liquor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, gladly, Lord,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; And to the town went the maiden.&nbsp; And they
conversed together, while the maiden was at the town.&nbsp; And,
behold! the maiden came back, and a youth with her, bearing on
his back a costrel full of good purchased mead and a quarter of a
young bullock.&nbsp; And in the hands of the maiden was a
quantity of white bread, and she had some manchet bread in her
veil, and she came into the chamber.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not
obtain better than this,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;nor with better
should I have been trusted.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is good
enough,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; And they caused the meat to be
boiled; and when their food was ready, they sat down.&nbsp; And
it was in this wise; Geraint sat between the hoary-headed man and
his wife, and the maiden served them.&nbsp; And they ate and
drank.</p>
<p>And when they had finished eating, Geraint talked with the
hoary-headed man, and he asked him in the first place, to whom
belonged the Palace that he was in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;it was I that built it, and to me also belonged
the city and the castle which thou sawest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;how is it that thou hast
lost them now?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I lost a great Earldom as well
as these,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and this is how I lost
them.&nbsp; I had a nephew, the son of my brother, and I took his
possessions to myself; and when he came to his strength, he
demanded of me his property, but I withheld it from him.&nbsp; So
he made war upon me, and wrested from me all that I
possessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good, Sir,&rdquo; <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> said Geraint, &ldquo;wilt thou tell me
wherefore came <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the knight, and the lady, and the
dwarf, just now into the town, and what is the preparation which
I saw, and the putting of arms in order.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will do so,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;The preparations are for
the game that is to be held to-morrow by the young Earl, which
will be on this wise.&nbsp; In the midst of a meadow which is
here, two forks will be set up, and upon the two forks a silver
rod, and upon the silver rod a Sparrow-Hawk, and for the
Sparrow-Hawk there will be a tournament.&nbsp; And to the
tournament will go all the array thou didst see in the city, of
men, and of horses, and of arms.&nbsp; And with each man will go
the lady he loves best; and no man can joust for the
Sparrow-Hawk, except the lady he loves best be with him.&nbsp;
And the knight that thou sawest has gained the Sparrow-Hawk these
two years; and if he gains it the third year, they will, from
that time, send it every year to him, and he himself will come
here no more.&nbsp; And he will be called the knight of the
Sparrow-Hawk from that time forth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;what is thy counsel to me
concerning this knight, on account of the insult which I received
from the dwarf, and that which was received by the maiden of
Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Geraint told the
hoary-headed man what the insult was that he had received.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not easy to counsel thee, inasmuch as thou hast
neither dame nor maiden belonging to thee, for whom thou canst
joust.&nbsp; Yet, I have arms here, which thou couldest have; and
there is my horse also, if he seem to thee better than thine
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;Heaven reward thee.&nbsp; But my own horse, to which I am
accustomed, together with thine arms, will suffice me.&nbsp; And
if, when the appointed time shall come to-morrow, thou wilt
permit me, Sir, to challenge for yonder maiden that <!-- page
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>is
thy daughter, I will engage, if I escape from the tournament, to
love the maiden as long as I live, and if I do not escape, she
will remain unsullied as before.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly will
I permit thee,&rdquo; said the hoary-headed man, &ldquo;and since
thou dost thus resolve, it is necessary that thy horse and arms
should be ready to-morrow at break of day.&nbsp; For then, the
knight of the Sparrow-Hawk will make proclamation, and ask the
lady he loves best to take the Sparrow-Hawk.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For,&rsquo; will he say to her, &lsquo;thou art the
fairest of women, and thou didst possess it last year, and the
year previous; and if any deny it thee to-day, by force will I
defend it for thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; And therefore,&rdquo; said the
hoary-headed man, &ldquo;it is needful for thee to be there at
daybreak; and we three will be with thee,&rdquo; and thus was it
settled.</p>
<p>And at night, lo! <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a> they went to sleep;
and before the dawn they arose, and arrayed themselves; and by
the time that it was day, they were all four in the meadow.&nbsp;
And there was the knight of the Sparrow-Hawk making the
proclamation, and asking his ladylove to fetch the
Sparrow-Hawk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fetch it not,&rdquo; said Geraint,
&ldquo;for there is here a maiden, who is fairer, and more noble,
and more comely, and who has a better claim to it than
thou.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou maintainest the Sparrow-Hawk to
be due to her, come forward, and do battle with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Geraint went forward to the top of the meadow, having upon
himself and upon his horse armour which was heavy, and rusty, and
worthless, and of uncouth shape.&nbsp; Then they encountered each
other, and they broke a set of lances, and they broke a second
set, and a third.&nbsp; And thus they did at every onset, and
they broke as many lances as were brought to <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>them.&nbsp;
And when the Earl and his company saw the knight of the
Sparrow-Hawk gaining the mastery, there was shouting, and joy,
and mirth amongst them.&nbsp; And the hoary-headed man, and his
wife, and his daughter, were sorrowful.&nbsp; And the
hoary-headed man served Geraint lances as often as he broke them,
and the dwarf served the knight of the Sparrow-Hawk.&nbsp; Then
the hoary-headed man came to Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!
chieftain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since no other will hold with
thee, behold, here is the lance which was in my hand on the day
when I received the honour of knighthood; and from that time to
this I never broke it.&nbsp; And it has an excellent
point.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Geraint took the lance, thanking the
hoary-headed <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>man.&nbsp; And thereupon the dwarf
also brought a lance to his lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold here is a
lance for thee, not less good than his,&rdquo; said the
dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;And bethink thee, that no knight ever
withstood thee before so long as this one has done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I declare to Heaven,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;that
unless death takes me quickly hence, he shall fare never the
better for thy service.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Geraint pricked his
horse towards him from afar, and warning him, he rushed upon him,
and gave him a blow so severe, and furious, and fierce, upon the
face of his shield, that he cleft it in two, and broke his
armour, and burst his girths, so that both he and his saddle were
borne to the ground over the horse&rsquo;s crupper.&nbsp; And
Geraint dismounted quickly.&nbsp; And he was wroth, and he drew
his sword, and rushed fiercely upon him.&nbsp; Then the knight
also arose, and drew his sword against Geraint.&nbsp; And they
fought on foot with their swords until their aims struck sparks
of fire like stars from one another; and thus they continued
fighting until the blood and sweat obscured the light from their
eyes.&nbsp; And when Geraint prevailed, the hoary-headed man, and
his wife, and his daughter were glad; and when the knight
prevailed, it rejoiced the Earl and his party.&nbsp; Then the
hoary-headed man saw Geraint receive a severe stroke, and he went
up to him quickly, and said to him, &ldquo;Oh, chieftain,
remember the treatment which thou hadst from the dwarf; and wilt
thou not seek vengeance for the insult to thyself, and for the
insult to Gwenhwyvar the wife of Arthur!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Geraint
was roused by what he said to him, <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a> and he called to him
all his strength, and lifted up his sword, and struck the knight
upon the crown of his head, so that he broke all his head armour,
and cut through <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>all the flesh and the skin, even to
the skull, until he wounded the bone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p18.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p18.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Then the knight fell upon his knees, and cast his sword from
his hand, and besought mercy of Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a
truth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I relinquish my overdaring and my
pride in craving thy mercy; and unless I have time to commit
myself to Heaven for my sins, and to talk with a priest, thy
mercy will avail me little.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will grant thee
grace upon this condition,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;that thou
wilt go to Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur, to do her satisfaction
for the insult which her maiden received from thy dwarf.&nbsp; As
to myself, for the insult which I received from thee and thy
dwarf, I am content with that which I have done unto thee.&nbsp;
Dismount not from the time thou goest hence until thou comest
into the presence of Gwenhwyvar, to make her what atonement shall
be adjudged at the Court of Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This will
I do gladly.&nbsp; And who art thou?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am Geraint the son of Erbin.&nbsp; And declare thou also
who thou art.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am Edeyrn the son of
Nudd.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he threw himself upon his horse, and went
forward to Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and the lady he loved best went
before him and the dwarf, with much lamentation.&nbsp; And thus
far this story up to that time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Then came the little Earl and his hosts to Geraint, and
saluted him, and bade him to his castle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may not
go,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;but where I was last night, there
will I be to-night also.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Since thou wilt none
of my inviting, thou shall have abundance of all that I can
command for thee, in the place thou wast last night.&nbsp; And I
will order ointment for thee, to recover thee from thy fatigues,
and from the weariness that is upon thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heaven reward thee,&rdquo; said Geraint, <!-- page 21--><a

will go to my lodging.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus went Geraint, and
Earl Ynywl, and his wife, and his daughter.&nbsp; And when they
reached the chamber, the household servants and attendants of the
young Earl had arrived at the Court, and they arranged all the
houses, dressing them with straw and with fire; and in a short
time the ointment was ready, and Geraint came there, and they
washed his head.&nbsp; Then came the young Earl, with forty
honourable knights from among his attendants, and those who were
bidden to the tournament.&nbsp; And Geraint came from the
anointing.&nbsp; And the Earl asked him to go to the hall to
eat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is the Earl Ynywl,&rdquo; said Geraint,
&ldquo;and his wife, and his daughter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They
are in the chamber yonder,&rdquo; said the Earl&rsquo;s
chamberlain, &ldquo;arraying themselves in garments which the
Earl has caused to be brought for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
not the damsel array herself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;except in
her vest and her veil, until she come to the Court of Arthur, to
be clad by Gwenhwyvar, in such garments as she may
choose.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the maiden did not array herself.</p>
<p>Then they all entered the hall, and they washed, and went, and
sat down to meat.&nbsp; And thus were they seated.&nbsp; On one
side of Geraint sat the young Earl, and Earl Ynywl beyond him;
and on the other side of Geraint was the maiden and her
mother.&nbsp; And after these all sat according to their
precedence in honour.&nbsp; And they ate.&nbsp; And they were
served abundantly, and they received a profusion of divers kind
of gifts.&nbsp; Then they conversed together.&nbsp; And the young
Earl invited Geraint to visit him next day.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
not, by Heaven,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;To the Court of
Arthur will I go with this maiden to-morrow.&nbsp; And it is
enough for me, as long as Earl Ynywl is in <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>poverty and
trouble; and I go chiefly to seek to add to his
maintenance.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, chieftain,&rdquo; said the
young Earl, &ldquo;it is not by my fault that Earl Ynywl is
without his possessions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo;
said Geraint, &ldquo;he shall not remain without them, unless
death quickly takes me hence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
chieftain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with regard to the disagreement
between me and Ynywl, I will gladly abide by thy counsel, and
agree to what thou mayest judge right between us.&rdquo; <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I but ask thee,&rdquo;
said Geraint, &ldquo;to restore to him what is his, and what he
should have received from the time he lost his possessions, even
until this day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will I do gladly, for
thee,&rdquo; answered he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Geraint,
&ldquo;whosoever is here who owes homage to Ynywl, let him come
forward, and perform it on the spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; And all the men
did so.&nbsp; And by that treaty they abided.&nbsp; And his
castle, and his town, and all his possessions, were restored to
Ynywl.&nbsp; And he received back all that he had lost, even to
the smallest jewel.</p>
<p>Then spoke Earl Ynywl to Geraint.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Chieftain,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;behold the maiden for
whom thou didst challenge at the tournament, I bestow her upon
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She shall go with me,&rdquo; said
Geraint, &ldquo;to the Court of Arthur; and Arthur and
Gwenhwyvar, they shall dispose of her as they will.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the next day they proceeded to Arthur&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; So
far concerning Geraint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Now, this is how Arthur hunted the stag.&nbsp; The men and the
dogs were divided into hunting parties, and the dogs were let
loose upon the stag.&nbsp; And the last dog that was let loose
was the favourite dog of <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Arthur.&nbsp;
Cavall was his name.&nbsp; And he left all the other dogs behind
him, and turned the stag.&nbsp; And at the second turn, the stag
came towards the hunting party of Arthur.&nbsp; And Arthur set
upon him.&nbsp; And before he could be slain by any other, Arthur
cut off his head.&nbsp; Then they sounded the death horn for
slaying, and they all gathered round.</p>
<p>Then came Kadyrieith to Arthur, and spoke to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;behold yonder is Gwenhwyvar,
and none with her save only one maiden.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Command Gildas the son of Caw, and all the scholars of the
Court,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;to attend Gwenhwyvar to the
palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they did so.</p>
<p>Then they all set forth, holding converse together concerning
the head of the stag, to whom it should be given.&nbsp; One
wished that it should be given to the lady best beloved by him,
and another to the lady whom he loved best.&nbsp; And all they of
the household and the knights disputed sharply concerning the
head.&nbsp; And with that they came to the palace.&nbsp; And when
Arthur and Gwenhwyvar heard them disputing about the head of the
stag, Gwenhwyvar said to Arthur, &ldquo;My lord, this is my
counsel concerning the stag&rsquo;s head; let it not be given
away until Geraint the son of Erbin shall return from the errand
he is upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Gwenhwyvar told Arthur what that
errand was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right gladly shall it be so,&rdquo; said
Arthur.&nbsp; And thus it was settled.&nbsp; And the next day
Gwenhwyvar caused a watch to be set upon the ramparts for
Geraint&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp; And after mid-day they beheld an
unshapely little man upon a horse, and after him, as they
supposed, a dame or a damsel, also on horseback, and after her a
knight of large stature, bowed down, and hanging his head low and
sorrowfully, and clad in broken and worthless armour.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>And before they came near to the gate, one of the watch
went to Gwenhwyvar, and told her what kind of people they saw,
and what aspect they bore.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not who they
are,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I know,&rdquo; said
Gwenhwyvar, &ldquo;this is the knight whom Geraint pursued, and
methinks that he comes not here by his own free will.&nbsp; But
Geraint has overtaken him, and avenged the insult to the maiden
to the uttermost.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon, behold a porter
came to the spot where Gwenhwyvar was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;at the gate there is a knight, and I saw never a
man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he.&nbsp; Miserable
and broken is the armour that he wears, and the hue of blood is
more conspicuous upon it than its own colour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Knowest thou his name?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he tells me that he is Edeyrn the son
of Nudd.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she replied, &ldquo;I know him
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Gwenhwyvar went to the gate to meet him, and he
entered.&nbsp; And Gwenhwyvar was sorry when she saw the
condition he was in, even though he was accompanied by the
churlish dwarf.&nbsp; Then Edeyrn saluted Gwenhwyvar.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heaven protect thee,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Geraint the son of Erbin, thy
best and most valiant servant, greets thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did he meet with thee?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and it was not to my
advantage; and that was not his fault, but mine, Lady.&nbsp; And
Geraint greets thee well; and in greeting thee he compelled me to
come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden
received from the dwarf.&nbsp; He forgives the insult to himself,
in consideration of his having put me in peril of my life.&nbsp;
And he imposed on me a condition, manly, and honourable, and
warrior-like, which was to do thee justice, Lady.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, where did he overtake thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At
the place where we were <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>jousting, and contending for the
Sparrow-Hawk, in the town which is now called Cardiff.&nbsp; And
there were none with him, save three persons, of a mean and
tattered condition.&nbsp; And these were an aged, hoary-headed
man and a woman advanced in years, and a fair young maiden, clad
in worn-out garments.&nbsp; And it was for the avouchment of the
love of that maiden that Geraint jousted for the Sparrow-Hawk at
the tournament; for he said that that maiden was better entitled
to the Sparrow-Hawk than this maiden who was with me.&nbsp; And
thereupon we encountered each other, and he left me, Lady, as
thou seest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when
thinkest thou that Geraint will be here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To-morrow, Lady, I think he will be here with the
maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Arthur came to him, and he saluted Arthur, and Arthur
gazed a long time upon him, and was amazed to see him thus.&nbsp;
And thinking that he knew him, he enquired of him, &ldquo;Art
thou Edeyrn the son of Nudd?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,
Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I have met with much trouble,
and received wounds unsupportable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he told
Arthur all his adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;from what I hear, it
behoves Gwenhwyvar to be merciful towards thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The mercy which thou desirest, Lord,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;will I grant to him, since it is as insulting to thee that
an insult should be offered to me as to thyself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thus will it be best to do,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;let
this man have medical care until it be known whether he may
live.&nbsp; And if he live, he shall do such satisfaction as
shall be judged best by the men of the Court; and take thou
sureties to that effect.&nbsp; And it he die, too much will be
the death of such a youth as Edeyrn for an insult to a
maiden.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This pleases me,&rdquo; said
Gwenhwyvar.&nbsp; And Arthur became surety for Edeyrn, <!-- page
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>and
Caradawc the son of Llyr, Gwallawg the son of Llenawg, and Owain
the son of Nudd, and Gwalchmai, and many others with them.&nbsp;
And Arthur caused Morgan Tud to be called to him.&nbsp; He was
the chief physician.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take with thee Edeyrn the son
of Nudd, and cause a chamber to be prepared for him, and let him
have the aid of medicine as thou wouldest do unto myself if I
were wounded, and let none into his chamber to molest him, but
thyself and thy disciples, to administer to him
remedies.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so, gladly, Lord,&rdquo;
said Morgan Tud.&nbsp; Then said the steward of the household,
&ldquo;Whither is it right, Lord, to order the
maiden?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To Gwenhwyvar and her and
maidens,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And the Steward of the Household
so ordered her.&nbsp; Thus far concerning them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The next day came Geraint towards the Court, and there was a
watch set on the ramparts by Gwenhwyvar, lest he should arrive
unawares.&nbsp; And one of the watch came to the place where
Gwenhwyvar was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;methinks that I see Geraint, and the maiden with
him.&nbsp; He is on horseback, but he has his walking gear upon
him, and the maiden appears to be in white, seeming to be clad in
a garment of linen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Assemble all the
women,&rdquo; said Gwenhwyvar, &ldquo;and come to meet Geraint,
to welcome him, and wish him joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Gwenhwyvar
went to meet Geraint and the maiden.&nbsp; And when Geraint came
to the place where Gwenhwyvar was, he saluted her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heaven prosper thee,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and welcome
to thee.&nbsp; And thy career has been successful, and fortunate,
and resistless, and glorious.&nbsp; And Heaven reward thee, that
thou hast so proudly caused me to have retribution.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>earnestly
desired to obtain thee satisfaction according to thy will; and,
behold, here is the maiden through whom thou hadst thy
revenge.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Gwenhwyvar,
&ldquo;the welcome of Heaven be unto her; and it is fitting that
we should receive her joyfully.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they went in,
and dismounted.&nbsp; And Geraint came to where Arthur was, and
saluted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven protect thee,&rdquo; said
Arthur, &ldquo;and the welcome of Heaven be unto thee.&nbsp; And
since <a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> Edeyrn the son of Nudd has received his
overthrow and wounds from thy hands, thou hadst had a prosperous
career.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not upon me be the blame,&rdquo; said
Geraint, &ldquo;it was through the arrogance of Edeyrn the son of
Nudd himself that we were not friends.&nbsp; I would not quit him
until I knew who he was, and until the one had vanquished the
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;where
is the maiden for whom I heard thou didst give
challenge?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She is gone with Gwenhwyvar to her
chamber.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then went Arthur to see the maiden.&nbsp;
And Arthur, and all his companions, and his whole Court, were
glad concerning the maiden.&nbsp; And certain were they all, that
had her array been suitable to her beauty, they had never seen a
maid fairer than she.&nbsp; And Arthur gave away the maiden to
Geraint.&nbsp; And the usual bond made between two persons was
made between Geraint and the maiden, and the choicest of all
Gwenhwyvar&rsquo;s apparel was given to the maiden; and thus
arrayed, she appeared comely and graceful to all who beheld
her.&nbsp; And that day and that night were spent in abundance of
minstrelsy, and ample gifts of liquor, and a multitude of
games.&nbsp; And when it was time for them to go to sleep, they
went.&nbsp; And in the chamber where the couch of <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Arthur and Gwenhwyvar was, the couch of Geraint and Enid
was prepared.&nbsp; And from that time she became his
bride.&nbsp; And the next day Arthur satisfied all the claimants
upon Geraint with bountiful gifts.&nbsp; And the maiden took up
her abode in the palace, and she had many companions, both men
and women, and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the
Island of Britain.</p>
<p>Then spake Gwenhwyvar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rightly did I
judge,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;concerning the head of the stag,
that it should not be given to any until Geraint&rsquo;s return;
and, behold, here is a fit occasion for bestowing it.&nbsp; Let
it be given to Enid, the daughter of Ynywl, the most illustrious
maiden.&nbsp; And I do not believe that any will begrudge it her,
for between her and every one here there exists nothing but love
and friendship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Much applauded was this by them all,
and by Arthur also.&nbsp; And the head of the stag was given to
Enid.&nbsp; And thereupon her fame increased, and her friends
thenceforward became more in number than before.&nbsp; And
Geraint from that time forth loved the stag, and the tournament,
and hard encounters; and he came victorious from them all.&nbsp;
And a year, and a second, and a third, he proceeded thus, until
his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom.</p>
<p>And once upon a time, Arthur was holding his Court at
Caerlleon upon Usk, at Whitsuntide.&nbsp; And, behold, there came
to him ambassadors, wise and prudent, full of knowledge, and
eloquent of speech, and they saluted Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven
prosper you,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;and the welcome of Heaven
be unto you.&nbsp; And whence do you come?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
come, Lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;from Cornwall; and we are
ambassadors from Erbin the son of Custennin, thy uncle, and our
mission is unto thee.&nbsp; And he greets <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>thee well, as
an uncle should greet his nephew, and as a vassal should greet
his lord.&nbsp; And he represents unto thee that he waxes heavy
and feeble, and is advancing in years.&nbsp; And the neighbouring
chiefs knowing this, grow insolent towards him, and covet his
land and possessions.&nbsp; And he earnestly beseeches thee,
Lord, to permit Geraint his son to return to him, to protect his
possessions, and to become acquainted with his boundaries.&nbsp;
And unto him he represents that it were better for him to spend
the flower of his youth, and the prime of his age, in preserving
his own boundaries, than in tournaments, which are productive of
no profit, although he obtains glory in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;go, and divest
yourselves of your accoutrements, and take food, and refresh
yourselves after your fatigues; and before you go forth hence you
shall have an answer.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they went to eat.&nbsp;
And Arthur considered that it would go hard with him to let
Geraint depart from him and from his Court; neither did he think
it fair that his cousin should be restrained from going to
protect his dominions and his boundaries, seeing that his father
was unable to do so.&nbsp; No less was the grief and regret of
Gwenhwyvar, and all her women, and all her damsels, through fear
that the maiden would leave them.&nbsp; And that day and that
night were spent in abundance of feasting.&nbsp; And Arthur
showed Geraint the cause of the mission, and of the coming of the
ambassadors to him out of Cornwall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
said Geraint, &ldquo;be it to my advantage or disadvantage, Lord,
I will do according to thy will concerning this
embassy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said Arthur,
&ldquo;though it grieves me to part with thee, it is my counsel
that thou go to dwell in thine own dominions, and to defend thy
boundaries, and to take with thee to accompany thee <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>as
many as thou wilt of those thou lovest best among my faithful
ones, and among thy friends, and among thy companions in
arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward thee; and this will I
do,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;What discourse,&rdquo; said
Gwenhwyvar, &ldquo;do I hear between you?&nbsp; Is it of those
who are to conduct Geraint to his country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is,&rdquo; said Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then is it needful for me to
consider,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;concerning companions and a
provision for the lady that is with me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
wilt do well,&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>And that night they went to sleep.&nbsp; And the next day the
ambassadors were permitted to depart, and they were told that
Geraint should follow them.&nbsp; And on the third day Geraint
set forth, and many went with him.&nbsp; Gwalchmai the son of
Gwyar, and Riogonedd the son of the king of Ireland, and Ondyaw
the son of the duke of Burgandy, Gwilim the son of the ruler of
the Franks, Howel the son of Emyr of Brittany, Elivry, and
Nawkyrd, Gwynn the son of Tringad, Goreu the son of Custennin,
Gweir Gwrhyd Vawr, Garannaw the son of Golithmer, Peredur the son
of Evrawc, Gwynnllogell, Gwyr a judge in the Court of Arthur,
Dyvyr the son of Alun of Dyved, Gwrei Gwalstawd Ieithoedd, Bedwyr
the son of Bedrawd, Hadwry the son of Gwryon, Kai the son of
Kynyr, Odyar the Frank, the Steward of Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and
Edeyrn the son of Nudd.&nbsp; Said Geraint, &ldquo;I think that I
shall have enough of knighthood with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;but it will not be fitting
for thee to take Edeyrn with thee, although he is well, until
peace shall be made between him and Gwenhwyvar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gwenhwyvar can permit him to go with me, if he gives
sureties.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If she please, she can let him go
without sureties, for enough of pain and affliction has he
suffered for the insult which the <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>maiden
received from the dwarf.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said
Gwenhwyvar, &ldquo;since it seems well to thee and to Geraint, I
will do this gladly, Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she permitted Edeyrn
freely to depart.&nbsp; And many there were who accompanied
Geraint, and they set forth; and never was there seen a fairer
host journeying towards the Severn.&nbsp; And on the other side
of the Severn were the nobles of Erbin the son of Custennin, and
his foster father at their head, to welcome Geraint with
gladness; and many of the women of the Court, with his mother,
came to receive Enid the daughter of Ynywl, his wife.&nbsp; And
there was great rejoicing and gladness throughout the whole
Court, and throughout all the country, concerning Geraint,
because of the greatness of their love towards him, and of the
greatness of the fame which he had gained since he went from
amongst them, and because he was come to take possession of his
dominions, and to preserve his boundaries.&nbsp; And they came to
the Court.&nbsp; And in the Court they had ample entertainment,
and a multitude of gifts, and abundance of liquor, and a
sufficiency of service, and a variety of minstrelsy and of
games.&nbsp; And to do honour to Geraint, all the chief men of
the country were invited that night to visit him.&nbsp; And they
passed that day and that night in the utmost enjoyment.&nbsp; And
at dawn next day Erbin arose, and summoned to him Geraint, and
the noble persons who had borne him company.&nbsp; And he said to
Geraint, &ldquo;I am a feeble and an aged man, and whilst I was
able to maintain the dominion for thee and for myself, I did
so.&nbsp; But thou art young, and in the flower of thy vigour and
of thy youth: henceforth do thou preserve thy
possessions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Geraint,
&ldquo;with my consent thou shalt not give the power over thy
dominions at <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>this time into my hands, and thou
shall not take me from Arthur&rsquo;s Court.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Into thy hands will I give them,&rdquo; said Erbin,
&ldquo;and this day also shalt thou receive the homage of thy
subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;It were better for thee to satisfy
those who have boons to ask, to-day, and to-morrow thou canst
receive the homage of thy dominions.&rdquo;&nbsp; So all that had
boons to ask were summoned into one place.&nbsp; And Kadyrieith
came to them, to know what were their requests.&nbsp; And every
one asked that which he desired.&nbsp; And the followers of
Arthur began to make gifts and immediately the men of Cornwall
came, and gave also.&nbsp; And they were not long in giving, so
eager was every one to bestow gifts.&nbsp; And of those who came
to ask gifts, none departed unsatisfied.&nbsp; And that day and
that night were spent in the utmost enjoyment.</p>
<p>And the next day, at dawn, Erbin desired Geraint to send
messengers to the men, to ask them whether it was displeasing to
them that he should come to receive their homage, and whether
they had anything to object to him.&nbsp; Then Geraint sent
ambassadors to the men of Cornwall, to ask them this.&nbsp; And
they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honour to
them for Geraint to come and receive their homage.&nbsp; So he
received the homage of such as were there.&nbsp; And they
remained with him till the third night.&nbsp; And the day after
the followers of Arthur intended to go away.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
too soon for you to go away yet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;stay with
me until I have finished receiving the homage of my chief men,
who have agreed to come to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they remained
with him until he had done so.&nbsp; Then they set forth towards
the Court of Arthur; and Geraint went to bear them company, and
Enid also, as far as Diganhwy: there they parted.&nbsp; <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Then
Ondyaw the son of the duke of Burgundy said to Geraint, &ldquo;Go
first of all, and visit the uttermost parts of thy dominions, and
see well to the boundaries of thy territories; and if thou hast
any trouble respecting them, send unto thy
companions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward thee,&rdquo; said
Geraint, &ldquo;and this will I do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Geraint
journeyed to the uttermost part of his dominions.&nbsp; And
experienced guides, and the chief men of his country, went with
him.&nbsp; And the furthermost point that they showed him he kept
possession of.</p>
<p>And, as he had been used to do when he was at Arthur&rsquo;s
Court, he frequented tournaments.&nbsp; And he became acquainted
with valiant and mighty men, until he had gained as much fame
there as he had formerly done elsewhere.&nbsp; And he enriched
his Court, and his companions, and his nobles, with the best
horses, and the best arms, and with the best and most valuable
jewels, and he ceased not until his fame had flown over the face
of the whole kingdom.&nbsp; And when he knew that it was thus, he
began to love ease and pleasure, for there was no one who was
worth his opposing.&nbsp; And he loved his wife, and liked to
continue in the palace, with minstrelsy and diversions.&nbsp; And
for a long time he abode at home.&nbsp; And after that he began
to shut himself up in the chamber of his wife, and he took no
delight in anything besides, insomuch that he gave up the
friendship of his nobles, together with his hunting and his
amusements, and lost the hearts of all the host in his Court; and
there was murmuring and scoffing concerning him among the
inhabitants of the palace, on account of his relinquishing so
completely their companionship for the love of his wife.&nbsp;
And these tidings came to Erbin.&nbsp; And when Erbin had heard
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>these things, he spoke unto Enid, and enquired of her
whether it was she that had caused Geraint to act thus, and to
forsake his people and his hosts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not I, by my
confession unto Heaven,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;there is nothing
more hateful to me than this.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she knew not what
she should do, for, although it was hard for her to own this to
Geraint, yet was it not more easy for her to listen to what she
heard without warning Geraint concerning it.&nbsp; And she was
very sorrowful.</p>
<p>And one morning in the summer time, they were upon their
couch, and Geraint lay upon the edge of it.&nbsp; And Enid was
without sleep in the apartment, which had windows of glass.&nbsp;
And the sun shone upon the couch.&nbsp; And the clothes had
slipped from off his arms and his breast, and he was
asleep.&nbsp; Then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his
appearance, and she said, &ldquo;Alas, and am I the cause that
these arms and this breast have lost their glory and the warlike
fame which they once so richly enjoyed!&rdquo;&nbsp; And as she
said this, the tears dropped from her eyes, and they fell upon
his breast.&nbsp; And the tears she shed, and the words she had
spoken, awoke him; and another thing contributed to awaken him,
and that was the idea that it was not in thinking of him that she
spoke thus, but that it was because she loved some other man more
than him, and that she wished for other society, and thereupon
Geraint was troubled in his mind, and he called his squire; and
when he came to him, &ldquo;Go quickly,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and prepare my horse and my arms, and make them
ready.&nbsp; And do thou arise,&rdquo; said he to Enid,
&ldquo;and apparel thyself; and cause thy horse to be accoutred,
and clothe thee in the worst riding dress that thou hast in thy
possession.&nbsp; And evil betide me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if
thou returnest <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>here until thou knowest whether I
have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say.&nbsp; And
if it be so, it will then be easy for thee to seek the society
thou didst wish for of him of whom thou wast
thinking.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she arose, and clothed herself in her
meanest garments.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know nothing, Lord,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;of thy meaning.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither wilt thou
know at this time,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Then Geraint went to see Erbin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I am going upon a quest, and I am not certain when I
may come back.&nbsp; Take heed, therefore, unto thy possessions,
until my return.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;but it is strange to me that thou shouldst go so
suddenly.&nbsp; And who will proceed with thee, since thou art
not strong enough to traverse the land of Lloegyr
alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But one person only will go with
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven counsel thee, my son,&rdquo; said
Erbin, &ldquo;and may many attach themselves to thee in
Lloegyr.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then went Geraint to the place where his
horse was, and it was equipped with foreign armour, heavy and
shining.&nbsp; And he desired Enid to mount her horse, and to
ride forward, and to keep a long way before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
whatever thou mayest see, and whatever thou mayest hear,
concerning me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do thou not turn
back.&nbsp; And unless I speak unto thee, say not thou one word
either.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they set forward.&nbsp; And he did not
choose the pleasantest and most frequented road, but that which
was the wildest and most beset by thieves, and robbers, and
venomous animals.&nbsp; And they came to a high road, which they
followed till they saw a vast forest, and they went towards it,
and they saw four armed horsemen come forth from the
forest.&nbsp; When they had beheld them, one of them said to the
other, &ldquo;Behold, here is a good occasion for us to capture
two horses <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>and armour, and a lady likewise; for
this we shall have no difficulty in doing against yonder single
knight, who hangs his head so pensively and heavily.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Enid heard this discourse, and she knew not what she should
do through fear of Geraint, who had told her to be silent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The vengeance of Heaven be upon me,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;if I would not rather receive my death from his hand than
from the hand of any other; and though he should slay me, yet
will I speak to him, lest I should have the misery to witness his
death.&rdquo; <a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a>&nbsp; So she waited for Geraint until
he came near to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;didst thou hear the words of those men concerning
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he lifted up his eyes, and looked at her
angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hadst only,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
hold thy peace as I bade thee.&nbsp; I wish but for silence and
not for warning. <a name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a>&nbsp; And though thou shouldst desire
to see my defeat and my death by the hands of those men, yet do I
feel no dread.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the foremost of them couched his
lance, and rushed upon Geraint.&nbsp; And he received him, and
that not feebly.&nbsp; But he let the thrust go by him, while he
struck the horseman upon the centre of his shield in such a
manner, that his shield was split, and his armour broken, and so
that a cubit&rsquo;s length of the shaft of Geraint&rsquo;s lance
passed through his body, and sent him to the earth the length of
the lance over his horse&rsquo;s crupper.&nbsp; Then the second
horseman attacked him furiously, being wroth at the death of his
companion.&nbsp; But with one thrust Geraint overthrew him also,
and killed him as he had done the other.&nbsp; Then the third set
upon him, and he killed him in like manner.&nbsp; And thus <!--
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>also he slew the fourth.&nbsp; Sad and sorrowful was the
maiden as she saw all this.&nbsp; Geraint dismounted his horse,
and took the arms of the men he had slain, and placed them upon
their saddles, and tied together the reins of their horses, and
he mounted his horse again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold what thou must
do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take the four horses, and drive them
before thee, and proceed forward, as I bade thee just now.&nbsp;
And say not one word unto me, unless I speak first unto
thee.&nbsp; And I declare unto Heaven,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if
thou doest not thus, it will be to thy cost.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will do, as far as I can, Lord,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;according to thy desire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they went
forward through the forest; and when they left the forest, they
came to a vast plain, in the centre of which was a group of
thickly tangled copse-wood; and from out thereof they beheld
three horsemen coming towards them, well equipped with armour,
both they and their horses.&nbsp; Then the maiden looked
steadfastly upon them; and when they had come near, she heard
them say one to another, &ldquo;Behold, here is a good arrival
for us, here are coming for us four horses and four suits of
armour.&nbsp; We shall easily obtain them spite of yonder
dolorous knight, and the maiden also will fall into our
power.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is but too true,&rdquo; said she
to herself, &ldquo;for my husband is tired with his former
combat.&nbsp; The vengeance of Heaven will be upon me, unless I
warn him of this.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the maiden waited until Geraint
came up to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;dost
thou not hear the discourse of yonder men concerning
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They say to one another, that they will easily obtain all
this spoil.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare to Heaven,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;that their words are less grievous to me than
that thou wilt not be silent, and abide by my <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>counsel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;I feared lest they should surprise thee
unawares.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold thy peace then,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;do not I desire silence?&rdquo; <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a>&nbsp; And thereupon one of the horsemen
couched his lance, and attacked Geraint.&nbsp; And he made a
thrust at him, which he thought would be very effective; but
Geraint received it carelessly, and struck it aside, and then he
rushed upon him, and aimed at the centre of his person, and from
the shock of man and horse, the quantity of his armour did not
avail him, and the head of the lance and part of the shaft passed
through him, so that he was carried to the ground an arm and a
spear&rsquo;s length over the crupper of his horse.&nbsp; And
both the other horsemen came forward in their turn, but their
onset was not more successful than that of their companion.&nbsp;
And the maiden stood by, looking at all this; and on the one hand
she was in trouble lest Geraint should be wounded in his
encounter with the men, and on the other hand she was joyful to
see him victorious.&nbsp; Then Geraint dismounted, and bound the
three suits of armour upon the three saddles, and he fastened the
reins of all the horses together, so that he had seven horses
with him.&nbsp; And he mounted his own horse, and commanded the
maiden to drive forward the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no more
use for me to speak to thee than to refrain, for thou wilt not
attend to my advice.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so, as far I
am able, Lord,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but I cannot conceal from
thee the fierce and threatening words which I may hear against
thee, Lord, from such strange people as those that haunt this
wilderness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare to Heaven,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;that I desire nought but silence; <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>therefore,
hold thy peace.&rdquo; <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,
Lord, while I can.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the maiden went on with the
horses before her, and she pursued her way straight
onwards.&nbsp; And from the copse-wood already mentioned, they
journeyed over a vast and dreary open plain.&nbsp; And at a great
distance from them they beheld a wood, and they could see neither
end nor boundary to the wood, except on that side that was
nearest to them, and they went towards it.&nbsp; Then there came
from out the wood five horsemen, eager, and bold, and mighty, and
strong, mounted upon chargers that were powerful, and large of
bone, and high-mettled, and proudly snorting, and both the men
and the horses were well equipped with arms.&nbsp; And when they
drew near to them, Enid heard them say, &ldquo;Behold, here is a
fine booty coming to us, which we shall obtain easily and without
labour, for we shall have no trouble in taking all those horses
and arms, and the lady also, from yonder single knight, so
doleful and sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorely grieved was the maiden upon hearing this discourse, so
that she knew not in the world what she should do.&nbsp; At last,
however, she determined to warn Geraint; so she turned her
horse&rsquo;s head towards him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;if thou hadst heard as I did what yonder horsemen
said concerning thee, thy heaviness would be greater than it
is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Angrily and bitterly did Geraint smile upon her,
and he said, &ldquo;Thee do I hear doing everything that I
forbade thee; but it may be that thou wilt repent this
yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And immediately, behold, the men met them, and
victoriously and gallantly did Geraint overcome them all
five.&nbsp; And he placed the five suits of armour upon the five
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>saddles, and tied together the reins of the twelve
horses, and gave them in charge to Enid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what good it is for me to order thee;
but this time I charge thee in an especial manner.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So the maiden went forward towards the wood, keeping in advance
of Geraint, as he had desired her; and it grieved him as much as
his wrath would permit, to see a maiden so illustrious as she
having so much trouble with the care of the horses.&nbsp; Then
they reached the wood, and it was both deep and vast; and in the
wood night overtook them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, maiden,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;it is vain to attempt proceeding forward!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;whatsoever thou
wishest, we will do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be best for
us,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to turn out of the wood, and to
rest, and wait for the day, in order to pursue our
journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will we, gladly,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; And they did so.&nbsp; Having dismounted himself, he
took her down from her horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot, by any
means, refrain from sleep, through weariness,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do thou, therefore, watch the horses, and sleep
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, Lord,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
Then he went to sleep in his armour, and thus passed the night,
which was not long at that season.&nbsp; And when she saw the
dawn of day appear, she looked around her, to see if he were
waking, and thereupon he woke.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;I have desired to awake thee for some
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he spake nothing to her about fatigue, <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> as he had desired her to be
silent.&nbsp; Then he arose, and said unto her, &ldquo;Take the
horses, and ride on; and keep straight on before thee as thou
didst yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; And early in the day they left the
wood, and they came to an open country, with meadows on one hand,
and mowers mowing the meadows.&nbsp; And there was a <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>river
before them, and the horses bent down, and drank the water.&nbsp;
And they went up out of the river by a lofty steep; and there
they met a slender stripling, with a satchel about his neck, and
they saw that there was something in the satchel, but they knew
not what it was.&nbsp; And he had a small blue pitcher in his
hand, and a bowl on the mouth of the pitcher.&nbsp; And the youth
saluted Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven prosper thee,&rdquo; said
Geraint, &ldquo;and whence dost thou come?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from the city that lies before
thee.&nbsp; My Lord,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;will it be
displeasing to thee, if I ask whence thou comest
also?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By no means&mdash;through yonder wood
did I come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou camest not through the wood
to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we were
in the wood last night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I warrant,&rdquo;
said the youth, &ldquo;that thy condition there last night was
not the most pleasant, and that thou hadst neither meat nor
drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, by my faith,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wilt thou follow my counsel,&rdquo; said the youth,
&ldquo;and take thy meal from me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What sort
of meal?&rdquo; he enquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;The breakfast which is
sent for yonder mowers, nothing less than bread and meat, and
wine; and if thou wilt, Sir, they shall have none of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and Heaven
reward thee for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Geraint alighted, and the youth took the maiden from off
her horse.&nbsp; Then they washed, and took their repast.&nbsp;
And the youth cut the bread in slices, and gave them drink, and
served them withal.&nbsp; And when they had finished, the youth
arose, and said to Geraint, &ldquo;My Lord, with thy permission I
will now go and fetch some food for the mowers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go, first, to the town,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;and
take a lodging for me in the best place that thou knowest, and
the most commodious one for the horses, and take thou <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>whichever horse and arms thou choosest in payment for
thy service and thy gift.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward thee,
Lord,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;and this would be ample to
repay services much greater than those I rendered unto
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to the town went the youth, and he took
the best and the most pleasant lodgings that he knew; and after
that he went to the palace, having the horse and armour with him,
and proceeded to the place where the Earl was, and told him all
his adventure.&nbsp; &ldquo;I go now, Lord,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to meet the young man, and to conduct him to his
lodging.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go gladly,&rdquo; said the Earl,
&ldquo;and right joyfully shall he be received here, if he so
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the youth went to meet Geraint, and told
him that he would be received gladly by the Earl in his own
palace; but he would go only to his lodgings.&nbsp; And he had a
goodly chamber, in which was plenty of straw, and draperies, and
a spacious and commodious place he had for the horses, and the
youth prepared for them plenty of provender.&nbsp; And after they
had disarrayed themselves, Geraint spoke thus to Enid:
&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the other side of the
chamber, and come not to this side of the house; and thou mayest
call to thee the woman of the house, if thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will do, Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;as thou
sayest.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon the man of the house came to
Geraint, and welcomed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, chieftain,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;hast thou taken thy meal?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; Then the youth spoke to him, and
enquired if he would not drink something before he met the
Earl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly, I will,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; So the
youth went into the town, and brought them drink.&nbsp; And they
drank.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must needs sleep,&rdquo; said
Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;and
whilst thou sleepest, I will go to see the Earl.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go, gladly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and come <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>here
again when I require thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Geraint went to
sleep, and so did Enid also.</p>
<p>And the youth came to the place where the Earl was, and the
Earl asked him where the lodgings of the knight were, and he told
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;to
wait on him in the evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,&rdquo;
answered the Earl, &ldquo;and greet him well from me, and tell
him that in the evening I will go to see him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This will I do,&rdquo; said the youth.&nbsp; So he came
when it was time for them to awake.&nbsp; And they arose, and
went forth.&nbsp; And when it was time for them to take their
food they took it.&nbsp; And the youth served them.&nbsp; And
Geraint enquired of the man of the house, whether there were any
of his companions that he wished to invite to him, and he said
that there were.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bring them hither, and entertain
them at my cost with the best thou canst buy in the
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man of the house brought there those whom he chose,
and feasted them at Geraint&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; Thereupon,
behold, the Earl came to visit Geraint, and his twelve honourable
knights with him.&nbsp; And Geraint rose up, and welcomed
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven preserve thee,&rdquo; said the
Earl.&nbsp; Then they all sat down according to their precedence
in honour.&nbsp; And the Earl conversed with Geraint and enquired
of him the object of his journey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
none,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but to seek adventures, and to
follow my own inclination.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the Earl cast his
eye upon Enid, and he looked at her steadfastly.&nbsp; And he
thought he had never seen a maiden fairer or more comely than
she.&nbsp; And he set all his thoughts and his affections upon
her.&nbsp; Then he asked of Geraint, &ldquo;Have I thy permission
to go and converse with yonder maiden, for I see that she is
apart from thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast it, gladly,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; So the <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Earl went to the place where the
maiden was, and spake with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, maiden,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;it cannot be pleasant to thee to journey thus
with yonder man!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not unpleasant to
me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to journey the same road that he
journeys.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast neither youths nor
maidens to serve thee,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
she replied, &ldquo;it is more pleasant for me to follow yonder
man than to be served by youths and maidens.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will give thee good counsel,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All my Earldom will I place in thy possession, if thou
wilt dwell with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will I not, by
Heaven,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;yonder man was the first to whom
my faith was ever pledged; and shall I prove inconstant to
him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art in the wrong,&rdquo; said the
Earl; &ldquo;if I slay the man yonder, I can keep thee with me as
long as I choose; and when thou no longer pleasest me, I can turn
thee away.&nbsp; But if thou goest with me by thy own good will,
I protest that our union shall continue eternal and undivided as
long as I remain alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she pondered these
words of his, and she considered that it was advisable to
encourage him in his request.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, then,
chieftain, this is most expedient for thee to do to save me any
needless imputation; come here to-morrow, and take me away as
though I knew nothing thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do
so,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; So he arose, and took his leave, and
went forth with his attendants.&nbsp; And she told not then to
Geraint any of the conversation which she had had with the Earl,
lest it should rouse his anger, and cause him uneasiness and
care.</p>
<p>And at the usual hour they went to sleep.&nbsp; And at the
beginning of the night Enid slept a little; and at midnight she
arose, and placed all Geraint&rsquo;s armour together, so that it
might be ready to put on.&nbsp; And <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>although
fearful of her errand, she came to the side of Geraint&rsquo;s
bed; and she spoke to him softly and gently, saying, &ldquo;My
Lord, arise, and clothe thyself, for these were the words of the
Earl to me, and his intention concerning me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she
told Geraint all that had passed.&nbsp; And although he was wroth
with her, he took warning, and clothed himself.&nbsp; And she
lighted a candle, that he might have light to do so.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Leave there the candle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and desire
the man of the house to come here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she went,
and the man of the house came to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dost thou know
how much I owe thee?&rdquo; asked Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
thou owest but little.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Take the eleven horses
and the eleven suits of armour.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward
thee, Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I spent not the value of
one suit of armour upon thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For that
reason,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou wilt be the richer.&nbsp; And
now wilt thou come to guide me out of the town?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will, gladly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and in which
direction dost thou intend to go?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish to
leave the town by a different way from that by which I entered
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the man of the lodgings accompanied him as
far as he desired.&nbsp; Then he bade the maiden to go on before
him; and she did so, and went straight forward, and his host
returned home.&nbsp; And he had only just reached his house,
when, behold, the greatest tumult approached that was ever
heard.&nbsp; And when he looked out he saw fourscore knights in
complete armour around the house, with the Earl Dwrm at their
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is the knight that was here?&rdquo; said
the Earl.&nbsp; &ldquo;By thy hand,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he
went hence some time ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore,
villain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;didst thou let him go without
informing me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord, thou didst not command
me to do so, else would I not have allowed him to <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>depart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What way dost thou think
that he took?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not, except that he went
along the high road.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they turned their
horses&rsquo; heads that way, and seeing the tracks of the horses
upon the high road, they followed.&nbsp; And when the maiden
beheld the dawning of the day, she looked behind her, and saw
vast clouds of dust coming nearer and nearer to her.&nbsp; And
thereupon she became uneasy, and she thought that it was the Earl
and his host coming after them.&nbsp; And thereupon she beheld a
knight appearing through the mist.&nbsp; &ldquo;By my
faith,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;though he should slay me, it were
better for me to receive my death at his hands, than to see him
killed without warning him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo;
she said to him, &ldquo;seest thou yonder man hastening after
thee, and many others with him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do see
him,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and in despite of all my orders, I
see that thou wilt never keep silence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he
turned upon the knight, and with the first thrust he threw him
down under his horse&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; And as long as there
remained one of the fourscore knights, he overthrew every one of
them at the first onset.&nbsp; And from the weakest to the
strongest, they all attacked him one after the other, except the
Earl: and last of all the Earl came against him also.&nbsp; And
he broke his lance, and then he broke a second.&nbsp; But Geraint
turned upon him, and struck him with his lance upon the centre of
his shield, so that by that single thrust the shield was split,
and all his armour broken, and he himself was brought over his
horse&rsquo;s crupper to the ground, and was in peril of his
life.&nbsp; And Geraint drew near to him; and at the noise of the
trampling of his horse the Earl revived.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mercy,
Lord,&rdquo; said he to Geraint.&nbsp; And Geraint granted him
mercy.&nbsp; But through the hardness of the ground where they
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>had fallen, and the violence of the stroke which they
had received, there was not a single knight amongst them that
escaped without receiving a fall, mortally severe, and grievously
painful, and desperately wounding, from the hand of Geraint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p48.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p48.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And Geraint journeyed along the high road that was before him,
and the maiden went on first; and near them they beheld a valley
which was the fairest ever seen, and which had a large river
running through it; and there was a bridge over the river, and
the high road led to the bridge.&nbsp; And above the bridge, upon
the opposite side of the river, they beheld a fortified town, the
fairest ever seen.&nbsp; And as they approached the bridge,
Geraint saw coming towards him from a thick copse a man mounted
upon a large and lofty steed, even of pace and spirited though
tractable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, knight,&rdquo; said Geraint,
&ldquo;whence comest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I come,&rdquo;
said he &ldquo;from the valley below us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Canst thou tell me,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;who is the
owner of this fair valley and yonder walled town?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will tell thee, willingly,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;Gwiffert Petit he is called by the Franks, but the Welsh
call him the Little King.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Can I go by yonder
bridge,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;and by the lower highway that
is beneath the town?&rdquo;&nbsp; Said the knight, &ldquo;Thou
canst not go by his tower <a name="citation47a"></a><a
href="#footnote47a" class="citation">[47a]</a> on the other side
of the bridge, unless thou dost intend to combat him; because it
is his custom to encounter every knight that comes upon his
lands.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare to Heaven,&rdquo; said
Geraint, &ldquo;that I will, nevertheless, pursue my journey that
way.&rdquo; <a name="citation47b"></a><a href="#footnote47b"
class="citation">[47b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou dost so,&rdquo;
said the knight, &ldquo;thou wilt probably meet with shame and
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>disgrace in reward for thy daring.&rdquo; <a
name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a>&nbsp; Then Geraint proceeded along the
road that led to the town, and the road brought him to a ground
that was hard, and rugged, and high, and ridgy. <a
name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a> And as he journeyed thus, he beheld a
knight following him upon a war-horse, strong, and large, and
proudly-stepping, and wide-hoofed, and broad-chested.&nbsp; And
he never saw a man of smaller stature than he who was upon the
horse.&nbsp; And both he and his horse were completely
armed.&nbsp; When he had overtaken Geraint he said to him,
&ldquo;Tell me, chieftain, whether it is through ignorance or
through presumption that thou seekest to insult my dignity, and
to infringe my rules?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered
Geraint, &ldquo;I knew not that this road was forbid to
any.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou didst know it,&rdquo; said the
other; &ldquo;come with me to my Court, to do me
satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will I not, by my
faith,&rdquo; said <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Geraint; &ldquo;I would not go even
to thy Lord&rsquo;s Court, excepting Arthur were thy
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By the hand of Arthur himself,&rdquo;
said the knight, &ldquo;I will have satisfaction of thee, or
receive my overthrow at thy hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; And immediately
they charged one another.&nbsp; And a squire of his came to serve
him with lances as he broke them.&nbsp; And they gave each other
such hard and severe strokes, that their shields lost all their
colour.&nbsp; But it was very difficult for Geraint to fight with
him on account of his small size, for he was hardly able to get a
full aim at him with all the efforts he could make. <a
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a>&nbsp; And they fought thus until their
horses were brought down upon their knees; and at length Geraint
threw the knight headlong to the ground; and then they fought on
foot, and they gave one another blows so boldly fierce, so
frequent, and so severely powerful, that their helmets were
pierced, and their skullcaps were broken, and their arms were
shattered, and the light of their eyes was darkened by sweat and
blood.&nbsp; At the last Geraint became enraged, and he called to
him all his strength; and boldly angry, and swiftly resolute, and
furiously determined, he lifted up his sword, and struck him on
the crown of his head a blow so mortally painful, so violent, so
fierce, and so penetrating, that it cut through all his head
armour, and his skin, and his flesh, until it wounded the very
bone, and the sword flew out of the hand of the Little King to
the furthest end of the plain, and he besought Geraint that he
would have mercy and compassion upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though
thou hast been neither courteous nor just,&rdquo; <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>said
Geraint, &ldquo;thou shalt have mercy, upon condition that thou
wilt become my ally, and engage never to fight against me again,
but to come to my assistance whenever thou hearest of my being in
trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This will I do, gladly, Lord,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; So he pledged him his faith thereof.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now, Lord, come with me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to my
Court yonder, to recover from thy weariness and
fatigue.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will I not, by Heaven,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>Then Gwiffert Petit beheld Enid where she stood, and it
grieved him to see one of her noble mien appear so deeply
afflicted.&nbsp; And he said to Geraint, &ldquo;My Lord, thou
doest wrong not to take repose, and refresh thyself awhile; for,
if thou meetest with any difficulty in thy present condition, it
will not be easy for thee to surmount it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Geraint would do no other than proceed on his journey, and he
mounted his horse in pain, and all covered with blood.&nbsp; And
the maiden went on first, and they proceeded towards the wood
which they saw before them.</p>
<p>And the heat of the sun was very great, and through the blood
and sweat, Geraint&rsquo;s armour cleaved to his flesh; and when
they came into the wood, he stood under a tree, to avoid the
sun&rsquo;s heat; and his wounds pained him more than they had
done at the time when he received them.&nbsp; And the maiden
stood under another tree.&nbsp; And, lo! they heard the sound of
horns, and a tumultuous noise, and the occasion of it was, that
Arthur and his company had come down to the wood.&nbsp; And while
Geraint was considering which way he should go to avoid them,
behold, he was espied by a foot page, who was an attendant on the
Steward of the Household, and he went to the steward, and told
him what kind of man he had seen in the wood.&nbsp; Then the
steward caused his horse to be <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>saddled, and
he took his lance and his shield, and went to the place where
Geraint was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, knight!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what
dost thou here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am standing under a shady
tree, to avoid the heat and the rays of the sun.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherefore is thy journey, and who art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I seek adventures, and go where I list.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Kai, &ldquo;then come with me to see
Arthur, who is here hard by.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will I not,
by Heaven,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou must needs
come,&rdquo; said Kai.&nbsp; Then Geraint knew who he was, but
Kai did not know Geraint.&nbsp; And Kai attacked Geraint as best
as he could.&nbsp; And Geraint became wroth, and he struck him
with the shaft of his lance, so that he rolled headlong to the
ground.&nbsp; But chastisement worse than this would he not
inflict on him.</p>
<p>Scared and wildly Kai arose, and he mounted his horse, and
went back to his lodging.&nbsp; And thence he proceeded to
Gwalchmai&rsquo;s tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Sir,&rdquo; said he to
Gwalchmai, &ldquo;I was told by one of the attendants, that he
saw in the wood above a wounded knight, having on battered
armour, and if thou dost right, thou wilt go and see if this be
true.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I care not if I do so,&rdquo; said
Gwalchmai.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take, then, thy horse, and some of thy
armour,&rdquo; said Kai, &ldquo;for I hear that he is not
over-courteous to those who approach him.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
Gwalchmai took his spear and his shield, and mounted his horse,
and came to the spot where Geraint was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir
Knight,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;wherefore is thy
journey?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I journey for my own pleasure, and
to seek the adventures of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt
thou tell me who thou art, or wilt thou come and visit Arthur,
who is near at hand?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will make no alliance
with thee, nor will I go and visit Arthur,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
And he knew that it was Gwalchmai, but Gwalchmai knew him
not.&nbsp; &ldquo;I <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>purpose not to leave thee,&rdquo;
said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;till I know who thou art.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he charged him with his lance, and struck him on his shield, so
that the shaft was shivered into splinters, and their horses were
front to front.&nbsp; Then Gwalchmai gazed fixedly upon him, and
he knew him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, Geraint,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is
it thou that art here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not
Geraint,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Geraint thou art, by
Heaven,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and a wretched and insane
expedition is this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he looked around, and
beheld Enid, and he welcomed her gladly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Geraint,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;come thou, and see
Arthur; he is thy lord and thy cousin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I am not in a fit state to go and
see any one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon, behold, one of the pages
came after Gwalchmai, to speak to him.&nbsp; So he sent him to
apprise Arthur that Geraint was there wounded, and that he would
not go to visit him, and that it was pitiable to see the plight
that he was in.&nbsp; And this he did without Geraint&rsquo;s
knowledge, inasmuch as he spoke in a whisper to the page.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Entreat Arthur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to have his tent
brought near to the road, for he will not meet him willingly, and
it is not easy to compel him in the mood he is in.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So the page came to Arthur, and told him this.&nbsp; And he
caused his tent to be removed unto the side of the road.&nbsp;
And the maiden rejoiced in her heart.&nbsp; And Gwalchmai led
Geraint onwards along the road, till they came to the place where
Arthur was encamped, and the pages were pitching his tent by the
road-side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;all
hail unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven prosper thee; and who
art thou?&rdquo; said Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is Geraint,&rdquo;
said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;and of his own free will would he not come
to meet thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Arthur,
&ldquo;he is bereft of his reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then came Enid,
and saluted Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven protect thee,&rdquo; <!--
page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>said he.&nbsp; And thereupon he caused one of the pages
to take her from her horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; Enid,&rdquo;
said Arthur, &ldquo;what expedition is this?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know not, Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;save that it
behoves me to journey by the same road that he
journeys.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said Geraint,
&ldquo;with thy permission we will depart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whither wilt thou go?&rdquo; said Arthur.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou canst not proceed now, unless it be unto thy
death.&rdquo; <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;He will not suffer himself
to be invited by me,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai.&nbsp; &ldquo;But by
me he will,&rdquo; said Arthur; &ldquo;and, moreover, he does not
go from here until he is healed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
rather, Lord,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;that thou wouldest let
me go forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will I not, I declare to
Heaven,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; Then he caused a maiden to be sent
for to conduct Enid to the tent where Gwenhwyvar&rsquo;s chamber
was.&nbsp; And Gwenhwyvar and all her women were joyful at her
coming, and they took off her riding dress, and placed other
garments upon her.&nbsp; Arthur also called Kadyrieith, and
ordered him to pitch a tent for Geraint, and the physicians, and
he enjoined him to provide him with abundance of all that might
be requisite for him.&nbsp; And Kadyrieith did as he had
commanded him.&nbsp; And Morgan Tud and his disciples were
brought to Geraint.</p>
<p>And Arthur and his hosts remained there nearly a month, whilst
Geraint was being healed.&nbsp; And when he was fully recovered,
Geraint came to Arthur, and asked his permission to depart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know not if thou art quite well.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In
truth I am, Lord,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall not
believe thee concerning that, but the physicians that were with
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Arthur caused the physicians to be summoned
to him, and asked them if it were true.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is true,
Lord,&rdquo; said Morgan <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Tud.&nbsp; So
the next day Arthur permitted him to go forth, and he pursued his
journey.&nbsp; And on the same day Arthur removed thence.&nbsp;
And Geraint desired Enid to go on, and to keep before him, as she
had formerly done.&nbsp; And she went forward along the high
road.&nbsp; And as they journeyed thus, they heard an exceeding
loud wailing near to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay thou here,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and I will go and see what is the cause of this
wailing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; Then
he went forward into an open glade that was near the road.&nbsp;
And in the glade he saw two horses, one having a man&rsquo;s
saddle, and the other a woman&rsquo;s saddle upon it.&nbsp; And,
behold, there was a knight lying dead in his armour, and a young
damsel in a riding dress standing over him, lamenting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah! Lady,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;what hath befallen
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I
journeyed here with my beloved husband, when, lo! three giants
came upon us, and without any cause in the world, they slew
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Which way went they hence?&rdquo; said
Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yonder by the high road,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; So he returned to Enid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;to the lady that is below yonder, and await me
there till I come.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was sad when he ordered her
to do thus, but nevertheless she went to the damsel, whom it was
ruth to hear, and she felt certain that Geraint would never
return.&nbsp; Meanwhile Geraint followed the giants, and overtook
them.&nbsp; And each of them was greater of stature than three
other men, and a huge club was on the shoulder of each.&nbsp;
Then he rushed upon one of them, and thrust his lance through his
body.&nbsp; And having drawn it forth again, he pierced another
of them through likewise.&nbsp; But the third turned upon him,
and struck him with his club, so that he split his shield, and
crushed his shoulder, and opened his wounds <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>anew, and all
his blood began to flow from him.&nbsp; But Geraint drew his
sword, and attacked the giant, and gave him a blow on the crown
of his head so severe, and fierce, and violent, that his head and
his neck were split down to his shoulders, and he fell
dead.&nbsp; So Geraint left him thus, and returned to Enid.&nbsp;
And when he saw her, he fell down lifeless from his horse.&nbsp;
Piercing, and loud, and thrilling was the cry that Enid
uttered.&nbsp; And she came and stood over him where he had
fallen.&nbsp; And at the sound of her cries came the Earl of
Limours, and the host that journeyed with him, whom her
lamentations brought out of their road.&nbsp; And the Earl said
to Enid, &ldquo;Alas, Lady, what hath befallen thee?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah! good Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the only man I have
loved, or ever shall love, is slain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he said to
the other, &ldquo;And what is the cause of thy
grief?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They have slain my beloved husband
also,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who was it that slew
them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Some giants,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;slew my best beloved, and the other knight went in pursuit
of them, and came back in the state thou seest, his blood flowing
excessively; but it appears to me that he did not leave the
giants without killing some of them, if not all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Earl caused the knight that was dead to be buried, but he thought
that there still remained some life in Geraint; and to see if he
yet would live, he had him carried with him in the hollow of his
shield, and upon a bier.&nbsp; And the two damsels went to the
court; and when they arrived there, Geraint was placed upon a
litter-couch in front of the table that was in the hall.&nbsp;
Then they all took off their travelling gear, and the Earl
besought Enid to do the same, and to clothe herself in other
garments.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not, by Heaven,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;be not
so sorrowful for this matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>&ldquo;It
were hard to persuade me to be otherwise,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will act towards thee in such wise, that thou needest
not be sorrowful, whether yonder knight live or die.&nbsp;
Behold, a good Earldom, together with myself, will I bestow on
thee; be, therefore, happy and joyful.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
declare to Heaven,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that henceforth I
shall never be joyful while I live.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, by
Heaven, I will not,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But by
Heaven thou shalt,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; So he took her with him
to the table against her will, and many times desired her to
eat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call Heaven to witness,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;that I will not eat until the man that is upon yonder bier
shall eat likewise.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou canst not fulfil
that,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;yonder man is dead
already.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will prove that I can,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; Then he offered her a goblet of liquor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Drink this goblet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it will
cause thee to change thy mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Evil betide
me,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;if I drink aught until he drink
also.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;it
is of no more avail for me to be gentle with thee than
ungentle.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he gave her a box in the ear.&nbsp;
Thereupon she raised a loud and piercing shriek, and her
lamentations were much greater than they had been before, for she
considered in her mind that had Geraint been alive, he durst not
have struck her thus.&nbsp; But, behold, at the sound of her cry
Geraint revived from his swoon, and he sat up on the bier, and
finding his sword in the hollow of his shield, he rushed to the
place where the Earl was, and struck him a fiercely-wounding,
severely-venomous, and sternly-smiting blow upon the crown of his
head, so that he clove him in twain, until his sword was stayed
by the table.&nbsp; Then all left the board and fled away.&nbsp;
And this was not so much through fear of the living as through
the <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>dread they felt at seeing the dead man rise up to slay
them.&nbsp; And Geraint looked upon Enid, and he was grieved for
two causes; one was, to see that Enid had lost her colour and her
wonted aspect; and the other, to know that she was in the
right.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;knowest thou
where our horses are?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know, Lord, where thy
horse is,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I know not where is the
other.&nbsp; Thy horse is in the house yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he
went to the house, and brought forth his horse, and mounted him,
and took up Enid from the ground, and placed her upon the horse
with him.&nbsp; And he rode forward.&nbsp; And their road lay
between two hedges.&nbsp; And the night was gaining on the
day.&nbsp; And, lo! they saw behind them the shafts of spears
betwixt them and the sky, and they heard the trampling of horses,
and the noise of a host approaching.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hear
something following us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I will put
thee on the other side of the hedge.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus he
did.&nbsp; And thereupon, behold, a knight pricked towards him,
and couched his lance.&nbsp; When Enid saw this, she cried out,
saying, &ldquo;Oh! chieftain, whoever thou art, what renown wilt
thou gain by slaying a dead man?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp;
Heaven,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is it Geraint?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, in truth,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who art
thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the Little King,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;coming to thy assistance, for I heard that thou
wast in trouble.&nbsp; And if thou hadst followed my advice, none
of these hardships would have befallen thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing can happen,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;without
the will of Heaven, though much good results from
counsel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Little King,
&ldquo;and I know good counsel for thee now.&nbsp; Come with me
to the court of a son-in-law of my sister, which is near here,
and thou shalt have the best medical assistance in the
kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so, <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>gladly,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; And Enid was placed
upon the horse of one of the Little King&rsquo;s squires, and
they went forward to the Baron&rsquo;s palace.&nbsp; And they
were received there with gladness, and they met with hospitality
and attention.&nbsp; And the next morning they went to seek
physicians; and it was not long before they came, and they
attended Geraint until he was perfectly well.&nbsp; And while
Geraint was under medical care, the Little King caused his armour
to be repaired, until it was as good as it had ever been.&nbsp;
And they remained there a fortnight and a month.</p>
<p>Then the Little King said to Geraint, &ldquo;Now will we go
towards my own Court, to take rest and amuse
ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Geraint,
&ldquo;we will first journey for one day more, and return
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said the
Little King, &ldquo;do thou go then.&rdquo;&nbsp; And early in
the day they set forth.&nbsp; And more gladly and more joyfully
did Enid journey with them that day than she had ever done.&nbsp;
And they came to the main road.&nbsp; And when they reached a
place where the road divided in two, they beheld a man on foot
coming towards them along one of these roads, and Gwiffert asked
the man whence he came.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;from an errand in the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell
me,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;which is the best for me to
follow of these two roads?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is the best
for thee to follow,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;for if thou goest
by this one, thou wilt never return.&nbsp; Below us,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;there is a hedge of mist, and within it are enchanted
games, and no one who has gone there has ever returned.&nbsp; And
the Court of the Earl Owain is there, and he permits no one to go
to lodge in the town except he will go to his Court.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I declare to Heaven,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;that we
will take the lower <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>road.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they went
along it until they came to the town.&nbsp; And they took the
fairest and pleasantest place in the town for their
lodging.&nbsp; And while they were thus, behold, a young man came
to them, and greeted them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven be propitious to
thee,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good Sirs,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what preparations are you making here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are taking up our lodging,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;to
pass the night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not the custom with him
who owns the town,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to permit any of
gentle birth, unless they come to stay in his Court, to abide
here; therefore, come you to the Court.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
will come, gladly,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; And they went with
the page, and they were joyfully received.&nbsp; And the Earl
came to the hall to meet them, and he commanded the tables to be
laid.&nbsp; And they washed, and sat down.&nbsp; And this is the
order in which they sat, Geraint on one side of the Earl, and
Enid on the other side, and next to Enid the Little King, and
then the Countess next to Geraint, and all after that as became
their rank.&nbsp; Then Geraint recollected the games, and thought
that he should not go to them; and on that account he did not
eat.&nbsp; Then the Earl looked upon Geraint, and considered, and
he bethought him that his not eating was because of the games,
and it grieved him that he had ever established those games, were
it only on account of losing such a youth as Geraint.&nbsp; And
if Geraint had asked him to abolish the games, he would gladly
have done so.&nbsp; Then the Earl said to Geraint, &ldquo;What
thought occupies thy mind, that thou dost not eat?&nbsp; If thou
hesitatest about going to the games, thou shall not go, and no
other of thy rank shall ever go either.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heaven reward thee,&rdquo; said Geraint, &ldquo;but I wish
nothing better than to go to the games, and to be shown the way
thither.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If that <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>is what thou
dost prefer, thou shalt obtain it willingly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do prefer it, indeed,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; Then they
ate, and they were amply served, and they had a variety of gifts,
and abundance of liquor.&nbsp; And when they had finished eating,
they arose.&nbsp; And Geraint called for his horse and his
armour, and he accoutred both himself and his horse.&nbsp; And
all the hosts went forth until they came to the side of the
hedge, and the hedge was so lofty, that it reached as high as
they could see in the air, and upon every stake in the hedge,
except two, there was the head of a man, and the number of stakes
throughout the hedge was very great.&nbsp; Then said the Little
King, &ldquo;May no one go in with the chieftain?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No one may,&rdquo; said Earl Owain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which way
can I enter?&rdquo; enquired Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
not,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;but enter by the way that thou
wilt, and that seemeth easiest to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then fearlessly and unhesitatingly Geraint dashed forward into
the mist.&nbsp; And on leaving the mist he came to a large
orchard, and in the orchard he saw an open space, wherein was a
tent of red satin, and the door of the tent was open, and an
apple-tree stood in front of the door of the tent, and on a
branch of the apple-tree hung a huge hunting horn.&nbsp; Then he
dismounted, and went into the tent, and there was no one in the
tent save one maiden sitting in a golden chair, and another chair
was opposite to her, empty.&nbsp; And Geraint went to the empty
chair, and sat down therein.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! chieftain,&rdquo;
said the maiden, &ldquo;I would not counsel thee to sit in that
chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The man to whom that chair belongs has never suffered
another to sit in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; said
Geraint, &ldquo;though it displease him that I sit in the
chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>they heard a
mighty tumult around the tent.&nbsp; And Geraint looked to see
what was the cause of the tumult.&nbsp; And he beheld without a
knight mounted upon a war-horse, proudly-snorting, high-mettled,
and large of bone, and a robe of honour in two parts was upon him
and upon his horse, and beneath it was plenty of armour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell me, chieftain,&rdquo; said he to Geraint, &ldquo;who
it was that bade thee sit there?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Myself,&rdquo; answered he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was wrong of
thee to do me this shame and disgrace.&nbsp; Arise, and do me
satisfaction for thine insolence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Geraint
arose, and they encountered immediately, and they broke a set of
lances; and a second set; and a third; and they gave each other
fierce and frequent strokes; and at last Geraint became enraged,
and he urged on his horse, and rushed upon him, and gave him a
thrust on the centre of his shield, so that it was split, and so
that the head of his lance went through his armour, and his
girths were broken, and he himself was borne headlong to the
ground the length of Geraint&rsquo;s lance and arm, over his
horse&rsquo;s crupper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my Lord!&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;thy mercy, and thou shalt have what thou
wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I only desire,&rdquo; said Geraint,
&ldquo;that this game shall no longer exist here, nor the hedge
of mist, nor magic, nor enchantment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
shalt have this gladly, Lord,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cause then the mist to disappear from this place,&rdquo;
said Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sound yonder horn,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and when thou soundest it, the mist will vanish; but it
will not go hence unless the horn be blown by the knight by whom
I am vanquished.&rdquo;&nbsp; And sad and sorrowful was Enid
where she remained, through anxiety concerning Geraint.&nbsp;
Then Geraint went and sounded the horn.&nbsp; And at the first
blast he gave, the mist vanished.&nbsp; And all the hosts came
together, <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and they all became reconciled to
each other.&nbsp; And the Earl invited Geraint and the Little
King to stay with him that night.&nbsp; And the next morning they
separated.&nbsp; And Geraint went towards his own dominions; and
thenceforth he reigned prosperously, and his warlike fame and
splendour lasted with renown and honour both to him and to Enid
from that time forward.</p>

<p>Kilydd, the son of Prince Kelyddon desired a wife as a
helpmate, and the wife that he chose was Goleuddydd, the daughter
of Prince Anlawdd.&nbsp; And after their union the people put up
prayers that they might have an heir.&nbsp; And they had a son
through the prayers of the people.&nbsp; From the time of her
pregnancy Goleuddydd became wild, and wandered about, without
habitation; but when her delivery was at hand, her reason came
back to her.&nbsp; Then she <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>went to a
mountain where there was a swineherd, keeping a herd of
swine.&nbsp; And through fear of the swine the queen was
delivered.&nbsp; And the swineherd took the boy, and brought him
to the palace; and he was christened, and they called him
Kilhwch, because he had been found in a swine&rsquo;s
burrow.&nbsp; Nevertheless the boy was of gentle lineage, and
cousin unto Arthur; and they put him out to nurse.</p>
<p>After this the boy&rsquo;s mother, Goleuddydd, the daughter of
Prince Anlawdd, fell sick.&nbsp; Then she called her husband unto
her, and said to him, &ldquo;Of this sickness I shall die, and
thou wilt take another wife.&nbsp; Now wives are the gift of the
Lord, but it would be wrong for thee to harm thy son.&nbsp;
Therefore I charge thee that thou take not a wife until thou see
a briar with two blossoms upon my grave.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this he
promised her.&nbsp; Then she besought him to dress her grave
every year, that nothing might grow thereon. <a
name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a>&nbsp; So the queen died.&nbsp; Now the
king sent an attendant every morning to see if anything were
growing upon the grave.&nbsp; And at the end of the seventh year
the master neglected that which he had promised to the queen.</p>
<p>One day the king went to hunt, and he rode to the place of
burial, to see the grave, and to know if it were time that he
should take a wife; and the king saw the briar.&nbsp; And when he
saw it, the king took counsel where he should find a wife.&nbsp;
Said one of his counsellors, &ldquo;I know a wife that will suit
thee well, and she is the wife of King Doged.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
they resolved to go to seek her; and they slew the king, <!--
page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>and brought away his wife and one daughter that she had
along with her.&nbsp; And they conquered the king&rsquo;s
lands.</p>
<p>On a certain day as the lady walked abroad, she came to the
house of an old crone that dwelt in the town, and that had no
tooth in her head.&nbsp; And the queen said to her, &ldquo;Old
woman, tell me that which I shall ask thee, for the love of
Heaven.&nbsp; Where are the children of the man who has carried
me away by violence?&rdquo;&nbsp; Said the crone, &ldquo;He has
not children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said the queen, &ldquo;Woe is me, that
I should have come to one who is childless!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
said the hag, &ldquo;Thou needest not lament on account of that,
for there is a prediction that he shall have an heir by thee, and
by none other.&nbsp; Moreover, be not sorrowful, for he has one
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady returned home with joy, and she asked her consort,
&ldquo;Wherefore hast thou concealed thy children from
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; The king said, &ldquo;I will do so no
longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he sent messengers for his son, and he
was brought to the Court.&nbsp; His stepmother said unto him,
&ldquo;It were well for thee to have a wife, and I have a
daughter who is sought of every man of renown in the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not yet of an age to wed,&rdquo;
answered the youth.&nbsp; Then said she unto him, &ldquo;I
declare to thee, that it is thy destiny not to be suited with a
wife until thou obtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden
Penkawr.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the youth blushed, and the love of the
maiden diffused itself through all his frame, although he had
never seen her.&nbsp; And his father enquired of him, &ldquo;What
has come over thee, my son, and what aileth thee?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;My stepmother has declared to me, that I shall never have
a wife until I obtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden
Penkawr.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will be easy for thee,&rdquo;
answered <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span

thy cousin.&nbsp; Go, therefore, unto Arthur, to cut thy hair,
and ask this of him as a boon.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p66.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>And the youth pricked forth upon a steed with head dappled
grey, of four winters old, firm of limb, with shell-formed hoofs,
having a bridle of linked gold on his head, and upon him a saddle
of costly gold.&nbsp; And in the youth&rsquo;s hand were two
spears of silver, sharp, well-tempered, headed with steel, three
ells in length, of an edge to wound the wind, and cause blood to
flow, and swifter than the fall <a name="citation66"></a><a
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a> of the dew-drop from
the blade of reed grass upon the earth, when the dew of June is
at the heaviest.&nbsp; A gold-hilted sword was upon his thigh,
the blade of which was of gold, bearing a cross of inlaid gold of
the hue of the lightning of heaven: his war-horn was of
ivory.&nbsp; Before him were two brindled white-breasted
greyhounds, having strong collars of rubies about their necks,
reaching from the shoulder to the ear.&nbsp; And the one <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>that was on the left side bounded across to the right
side, and the one on the right to the left, and like two sea
swallows sported around him.&nbsp; And his courser cast up four
sods with his four hoofs, like four swallows in the air, about
his head, now above, now below.&nbsp; About him was a
four-cornered cloth of purple, and an apple of gold was at each
corner; and every one of the apples was of the value of an
hundred kine.&nbsp; And there was precious gold of the value of
three hundred kine upon his shoes, and upon his stirrups, from
his knee to the tip of his toe.&nbsp; And the blade of grass bent
not beneath him, so light was his courser&rsquo;s tread as he
journeyed towards the gate of Arthur&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>Spoke the youth, &ldquo;Is there a porter?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is; and if thou holdest not thy peace, small will be
thy welcome. <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a>&nbsp; I am Arthur&rsquo;s porter every
first day of January.&nbsp; And during every other part of the
year but this the office is filled by Huandaw, and Gogigwc, and
Llaeskenym, and Pennpingyon, who goes upon his head to save his
feet, neither towards the sky nor towards the earth, but like a
rolling stone upon the floor of the Court.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Open the portal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not open
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore not?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
knife is in the meat, and the drink is in the horn, and there is
revelry in Arthur&rsquo;s hall, and none may enter therein but
the son of a king of a privileged country, or a craftsman
bringing his craft.&nbsp; But there will be refreshment for thy
dogs, and for thy horses; and for thee there will be collops
cooked and peppered, and luscious wine and mirthful songs, and
food for fifty men shall be brought unto thee in the guest
chamber, where the stranger and the sons of other countries eat,
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>who come not unto the precincts of the Palace of
Arthur.&nbsp; Thou wilt fare no worse there than thou wouldest
with Arthur in the Court.&nbsp; A lady shall smooth thy couch,
and shall lull thee with songs; and early to-morrow morning, when
the gate is open for the multitude that came hither to-day, for
thee shall it be opened first, and thou mayest sit in the place
that thou shall choose in Arthur&rsquo;s Hall, from the upper end
to the lower.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said the youth, &ldquo;That will I not
do.&nbsp; If thou openest the gate, it is well.&nbsp; If thou
dost not open it, I will bring disgrace upon thy Lord, and evil
report upon thee.&nbsp; And I will set up three shouts at this
very gate, than which none were ever more deadly, from the top of
Pengwaed in Cornwall to the bottom of Dinsol, in the North, and
to Esgair Oervel, in Ireland.&nbsp; And all the women in this
Palace that are pregnant shall lose their offspring; and such as
are not pregnant, their hearts shall be turned by illness, so
that they shall never bear children from this day
forward.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What clamour soever thou mayest
make,&rdquo; said Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr, &ldquo;against the laws of
Arthur&rsquo;s Palace, shalt thou not enter therein, until I
first go and speak with Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Glewlwyd went
into the Hall.&nbsp; And Arthur said to him, &ldquo;Hast thou
news from the gate?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Half of my life is past,
and half of thine.&nbsp; I was heretofore in Kaer Se and Asse, in
Sach and Salach, in Lotor and Fotor; and I have been heretofore
in India the Great and India the Lesser; and I was in the battle
of Dau Ynyr, when the twelve hostages were brought from
Llychlyn.&nbsp; And I have also been in Europe, and in Africa,
and in the Islands of Corsica, and in Caer Brythwch, and
Brythach, and Verthach; and I was present when formerly thou
didst slay the family of Clis the son of Merin, and <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>when
thou didst slay Mil Du, the son of Ducum, and when thou didst
conquer Greece in the East.&nbsp; And I have been in Caer Oeth
and Annoeth, and in Caer Nevenhyr; nine supreme sovereigns,
handsome men, saw we there, but never did I behold a man of equal
dignity with him who is now at the door of the
portal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Arthur, &ldquo;If walking thou
didst enter in here, return thou running.&nbsp; And every one
that beholds the light, and every one that opens and shuts the
eye, let him show him respect, and serve him, some with
gold-mounted drinking horns, others with collops cooked and
peppered, until food and drink can be prepared for him.&nbsp; It
is unbecoming to keep such a man as thou sayest he is in the wind
and the rain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Kai, &ldquo;By the hand of my
friend, if thou wouldest follow my counsel, thou wouldest not
break through the laws of the Court because of him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not so, blessed Kai, it is an honour to us to be resorted
to, and the greater our courtesy, the greater will be our renown,
and our fame, and our glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Glewlwyd came to the gate, and opened the gate before him;
and although all dismounted upon the horse-block at the gate, yet
did he not dismount, but he rode in upon his charger.&nbsp; Then
said Kilhwch, &ldquo;Greeting be unto thee, Sovereign Ruler of
this Island; and be this greeting no less unto the lowest than
unto the highest, and be it equally unto thy guests, and thy
warriors, and thy chieftains&mdash;let all partake of it as
completely as thyself.&nbsp; And complete be thy favour, and thy
fame, and thy glory, throughout all this Island.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Greeting unto thee also,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;sit
thou between two of my warriors, and thou shalt have minstrels
before thee, and thou shalt enjoy the privileges of a king born
to a throne, as long as thou remainest here.&nbsp; And when I
dispense my <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>presents to the visitors and
strangers in this Court, they shall be in thy hand at my
commencing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said the youth, &ldquo;I came not here
to consume meat and drink; but if I obtain the boon that I seek,
I will requite it thee, and extol thee; and if I have it not, I
will bear forth thy dispraise to the four quarters of the world,
as far as thy renown has extended.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Arthur,
&ldquo;Since thou wilt not remain here, chieftain, thou shalt
receive the boon whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far as the
wind dries and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves, and the
sea encircles, and the earth extends; save only my ship; and my
mantle; and Caledvwlch, my sword, and Rhongomyant, my lance; and
Wynebgwrthucher, my shield; and Carnwenhau, <a
name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a> my dagger; and Gwenhwyvar, my
wife.&nbsp; By the truth of Heaven, thou shalt have it
cheerfully, name what thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I would that
thou bless <a name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b"
class="citation">[70b]</a> my hair.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That
shalt be granted thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Arthur took a golden comb, and scissors, whereof the loops
were of silver, and he combed his hair.&nbsp; And Arthur enquired
of him who he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my heart warms unto thee, and
I know that thou art come of my blood.&nbsp; Tell me, therefore,
who thou art.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell thee,&rdquo; said
the youth, &ldquo;I am Kilhwch, the son of Kilydd, the son of
Prince Kelyddon, by Goleuddydd, my mother, the daughter of Prince
Anlawdd.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said
Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art my cousin.&nbsp; Whatsoever boon
thou mayest ask, thou shalt receive, be it what it may that thy
tongue shall name.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pledge the truth of Heaven
and the faith of thy kingdom thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
pledge it thee, gladly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I crave of thee then,
that thou obtain for me Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden <!--

Kynn-Crog.&nbsp; (She lived three ages.)&nbsp; Essyllt Vinwen,
and Essyllt Vingul.&rdquo;&nbsp; And all these did Kilhwch son of
Kilydd adjure to obtain his boon.</p>
<p>Then said Arthur, &ldquo;Oh! Chieftain, I have never heard of
the maiden of whom thou speakest, nor of <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>her kindred,
but I will gladly send messengers in search of her.&nbsp; Give me
time to seek her.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the youth said, &ldquo;I will
willingly grant from this night to that at the end of the year to
do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Arthur sent messengers to every land
within his dominions, to seek for the maiden, and at the end of
the year Arthur&rsquo;s messengers returned without having gained
any knowledge or intelligence concerning Olwen, more than on the
first day.&nbsp; Then said Kilhwch, &ldquo;Every one has received
his boon, and I yet lack mine.&nbsp; I will depart and bear away
thy honour with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Kai, &ldquo;Rash
chieftain! dost thou reproach Arthur?&nbsp; Go with us, and we
will not part until thou dost either confess that the maiden
exists not in the world, or until we obtain her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon Kai rose up.&nbsp; Kai had this peculiarity, that his
breath lasted nine nights and nine days under water, and he could
exist nine nights and nine days without sleep.&nbsp; A wound from
Kai&rsquo;s sword no physician could heal.&nbsp; Very subtle was
Kai.&nbsp; When it pleased him he could render himself as tall as
the highest tree in the forest.&nbsp; And he had another
peculiarity,&mdash;so great was the heat of his nature, that when
it rained hardest, whatever he carried remained dry for a
handbreadth above and a handbreadth below his hand; and when his
companions were coldest, it was to them as fuel with which to
light their fire.</p>
<p>And Arthur called Bedwyr, who never shrank from any enterprise
upon which Kai was bound.&nbsp; None were equal to him in
swiftness throughout this Island except Arthur and Drych Ail
Kibddar.&nbsp; And although he was one-handed, three warriors
could not shed blood faster than he on the field of battle.&nbsp;
Another property he had, his lance would produce a wound equal to
those of nine opposing lances.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>And Arthur called to Kynddelig the Guide, &ldquo;Go thou
upon this expedition with the chieftain.&rdquo;&nbsp; For as good
a guide was he in a land which he had never seen as he was in his
own.</p>
<p>He called Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, because he knew all
tongues.</p>
<p>He called Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, because he never
returned home without achieving the adventure of which he went in
quest.&nbsp; He was the best of footmen and the best of
knights.&nbsp; He was nephew to Arthur, the son of his sister,
and his cousin.</p>
<p>And Arthur called Menw the son of Teirgwaedd, in order that if
they went into a savage country, he might cast a charm and an
illusion over them, so that none might see them, whilst they
could see every one.</p>
<p>They journeyed until they came to a vast open plain, wherein
they saw a great castle, which was the fairest of the castles of
the world.&nbsp; And they journeyed that day until the evening,
and when they thought they were nigh to the castle, they were no
nearer to it than they had been in the morning.&nbsp; And the
second and the third day they journeyed, and even then scarcely
could they reach so far.&nbsp; And when they came before the
castle, they beheld a vast flock of sheep, which was boundless,
and without an end.&nbsp; And upon the top of a mound there was a
herdsman, keeping the sheep.&nbsp; And a rug made of skins was
upon him; and by his side was a shaggy mastiff, larger than a
steed nine winters old.&nbsp; Never had he lost even a lamb from
his flock, much less a large sheep.&nbsp; He let no occasion ever
pass without doing some hurt and harm.&nbsp; All the dead trees
and bushes in the plain he burnt with his breath down to the very
ground.</p>
<p>Then said Kai, &ldquo;Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, <!-- page
81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>go
thou and salute yonder man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Kai,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I engaged not to go further than thou
thyself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us go then together,&rdquo;
answered Kai. <a name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a"
class="citation">[81a]</a>&nbsp; Said Menw the son of Teirgwaedd,
&ldquo;Fear not to go thither, for I will cast a spell upon the
dog, so that he shall injure no one.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they went
up to the mound whereon the herdsman was, and they said to him,
&ldquo;How dost thou fare?&nbsp; O herdsman!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No less fair be it to you than to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Truly, art thou the chief?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no
hurt to injure me but my own.&rdquo; <a name="citation81b"></a><a
href="#footnote81b" class="citation">[81b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose
are the sheep that thou dost keep, and to whom does yonder castle
belong?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stupid are ye, truly!&nbsp; Through
the whole world is it known that this is the castle of Yspaddaden
Penkawr.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And who art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am called Custennin the son of Dyfnedig, and my brother
Yspaddaden Penkawr oppressed me because of my possession.&nbsp;
And ye also, who are ye?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are an embassy
from Arthur, come to seek Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden
Penkawr.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh men! the mercy of Heaven be upon
you, do not that for all the world.&nbsp; None who ever came
hither on this quest has returned alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
herdsman rose up.&nbsp; And as he arose, Kilhwch gave unto him a
ring of gold.&nbsp; And he sought to put on the ring, but it was
too small for him, so he placed it in the finger of his
glove.&nbsp; And he went home, and gave the glove to his spouse
to keep.&nbsp; And she took the ring from the glove when it was
given her, and she said, &ldquo;Whence came this ring, for thou
art not wont to have good fortune?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
went,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the sea to seek for fish, and lo,
I saw a corpse borne by the waves.&nbsp; And a fairer corpse <!--
page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>than it did I never behold.&nbsp; And from its finger
did I take this ring.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh man! does the sea
permit its dead to wear jewels?&nbsp; Show me then this
body.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh wife, him to whom this ring belonged
thou shalt see herein the evening.&rdquo; <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo;
asked the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kilhwch the son of Kilydd, the son
of Prince Kelyddon, by Goleuddydd the daughter of Prince Anlawdd,
his mother, who is come to seek Olwen as his wife.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And when she heard that, her feelings were divided between the
joy that she had that her nephew, the son of her sister, was
coming to her, and sorrow because she had never known any one
depart alive who had come on that quest.</p>
<p>And they went forward to the gate of Custennin the
herdsman&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; And when she heard their
footsteps approaching, she ran out with joy to meet them.&nbsp;
And Kai snatched a billet out of the pile.&nbsp; And when she met
them she sought to throw her arms about their necks.&nbsp; And
Kai placed the log between her two hands, and she squeezed it so
that it became a twisted coil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh woman,&rdquo; said
Kai, &ldquo;if thou hadst squeezed me thus, none could ever again
have set their affections on me.&nbsp; Evil love were
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; They entered into the house, and were served;
and soon after they all went forth to amuse themselves.&nbsp;
Then the woman opened a stone chest that was before the chimney
corner, and out of it arose a youth with yellow curling
hair.&nbsp; Said Gwrhyr, &ldquo;It is a pity to hide this
youth.&nbsp; I know that it is not his own crime that is thus
visited upon him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is but a
remnant,&rdquo; said the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three and twenty of
my sons has Yspaddaden Penkawr slain, <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>and I have no
more hope of this one than of the others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said
Kai, &ldquo;Let him come and be a companion with me, and he shall
not be slain unless I also am slain with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
they ate.&nbsp; And the woman asked them, &ldquo;Upon what errand
come you here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We come to seek Olwen for this
youth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said the woman, &ldquo;In the name of
Heaven, since no one from the castle hath yet seen you, return
again whence you came.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven is our witness,
that we will not return until we have seen the
maiden.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Kai, &ldquo;Does she ever come hither,
so that she may be seen?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She comes here every
Saturday to wash her head, and in the vessel where she washes,
she leaves all her rings, and she never either comes herself or
sends any messengers to fetch them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will she
come here if she is sent to?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven knows
that I will not destroy my soul, nor will I betray those that
trust me; unless you will pledge me your faith that you will not
harm her, I will not send to her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We pledge
it,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; So a message was sent, and she
came.</p>
<p>The maiden was clothed in a robe of flame-coloured silk, and
about her neck was a collar of ruddy gold, on which were precious
emeralds and rubies.&nbsp; More yellow was her head than the
flower of the broom, and her skin was whiter than the foam of the
wave, and fairer were her hands and her fingers than the blossoms
of the wood anemone amidst the spray of the meadow
fountain.&nbsp; The eye of the trained hawk, the glance of the
three-mewed falcon, was not brighter than hers.&nbsp; Her bosom
was more snowy than the breast of the white swan, her cheek was
redder than the reddest roses.&nbsp; Whoso beheld her was filled
with her love.&nbsp; Four white trefoils sprung up wherever she
trod.&nbsp; And therefore was she called Olwen.</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>She entered the house, and sat beside Kilhwch upon the
foremost bench; and as soon as he saw her he knew her.&nbsp; And
Kilhwch said unto her, &ldquo;Ah! maiden, thou art she whom I
have loved; come away with me lest they speak evil of thee and of
me.&nbsp; Many a day have I loved thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
cannot do this, for I have pledged my faith to my father not to
go without his counsel, for his life will last only until the
time of my espousals.&nbsp; Whatever is, must be.&nbsp; But I
will give thee advice if thou wilt take it.&nbsp; Go, ask me of
my father, and that which he shall require of thee, grant it, and
thou wilt obtain me; but if thou deny him anything, thou wilt not
obtain me, and it will be well for thee if thou escape with thy
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I promise all this, if occasion
offer,&rdquo; said he. <a name="citation84a"></a><a
href="#footnote84a" class="citation">[84a]</a></p>
<p>She returned to her chamber, and they all rose up and followed
her to the castle.&nbsp; And they slew the nine porters that were
at the nine gates in silence.&nbsp; And they slew the nine
watch-dogs without one of them barking.&nbsp; And they went
forward to the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greeting of Heaven and of man be unto thee,
Yspaddaden Penkawr,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you,
wherefore come you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We come to ask thy
daughter Olwen, for Kilhwch the son of Kilydd, the son of Prince
Kelyddon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are my pages and my servants?
<a name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a>&nbsp; Raise up the forks beneath my
two eyebrows which have fallen over my eyes, that I may see the
fashion of my son-in-law.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they did so.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come hither to-morrow, and you shall have an
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rose to go forth, and Yspaddaden Penkawr seized one of
the three poisoned darts that lay beside him, and threw it after
them.&nbsp; And Bedwyr caught <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>it, and flung
it, and pierced Yspaddaden Penkawr grievously with it through the
knee. <a name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a"
class="citation">[85a]</a>&nbsp; Then he said, &ldquo;A cursed
ungentle son-in-law, truly.&nbsp; I shall ever walk the worse for
his rudeness, and shall ever be without a cure.&nbsp; This
poisoned iron pains me like the bite of a gad-fly.&nbsp; Cursed
be the smith who forged it, and the anvil whereon it was
wrought!&nbsp; So sharp is it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night also they took up their abode in the house of
Custennin the herdsman.&nbsp; The next day with the dawn, they
arrayed themselves in haste, and proceeded to the castle, and
entered the hall, and they said, &ldquo;Yspaddaden Penkawr, give
us thy daughter in consideration of her dower and her maiden fee,
which we will pay to thee and to her two kinswomen
likewise.&nbsp; And unless thou wilt do so, thou shall meet with
thy death on her account.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he said, &ldquo;Her
four great-grandmothers, and her four great-grandsires are yet
alive, it is needful that I take counsel of them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; answered they, &ldquo;we will go to
meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; As they rose up; he took the second dart that
was beside him, and cast it after them.&nbsp; And Menw the son of
Gwaedd caught it, and flung it back at him, and wounded him in
the centre of the breast, so that it came out at the small of his
back.&nbsp; &ldquo;A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;the hard iron pains me like the bite of a
horse-leech.&nbsp; Cursed be the hearth whereon it was heated,
and the smith who formed it!&nbsp; So sharp is it!&nbsp;
Henceforth, whenever I go up a hill, I shall have a scant in my
breath, and a pain in my chest, and I shall often loathe my
food.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they went to meat.</p>
<p>And the third day they returned to the palace.&nbsp; <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>And
Yspaddaden Penkawr said to them, &ldquo;Shoot not at me again
unless you desire death.&nbsp; Where are my attendants?&nbsp;
Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have fallen over my
eyeballs, that I may see the fashion of my
son-in-law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they arose, and, as they did so,
Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart, and cast it at
them.&nbsp; And Kilhwch caught it, and threw it vigorously, and
wounded him through the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the
back of his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;A cursed ungentle son-in-law,
truly!&nbsp; As long as I remain alive, my eyesight will be the
worse.&nbsp; Whenever I go against the wind, my eyes will water;
and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a giddiness
every new moon.&nbsp; Cursed be the fire in which it was
forged.&nbsp; Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this
poisoned iron.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they went to meat.</p>
<p>And the next day they came again to the palace, and they said,
&ldquo;Shoot not at us any more, unless thou desirest such hurt,
and harm, and torture as thou now hast, and even more.&nbsp; Give
me thy daughter; and if thou wilt not give her, thou shall
receive thy death because of her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is he
that seeks my daughter?&nbsp; Come hither where I may see
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they placed him a chair face to face with
him.</p>
<p>Said Yspaddaden Penkawr, &ldquo;Is it thou that seekest my
daughter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; answered
Kilhwch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must have thy pledge that thou wilt not
do towards me otherwise than is just, and, when I have gotten
that which I shall name, my daughter thou shalt
have.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I promise thee that willingly,&rdquo;
said Kilhwch; &ldquo;name what thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will do so,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>All that day they journeyed until the evening, and <!-- page
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>then
they beheld a vast castle, which was the largest in the
world.&nbsp; And lo, a black man, huger than three of the men of
this world, came out from the castle.&nbsp; And they spoke unto
him, &ldquo;Whence comest them, O man?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From
the castle which you see yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose castle
is that?&rdquo; asked they.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stupid are ye truly, O
men.&nbsp; There is no one in the world that does not know to
whom this castle belongs.&nbsp; It is the castle of Gwrnach the
Giant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What treatment is there for guests and
strangers that alight in that castle?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!
chieftain, Heaven protect thee.&nbsp; No guest ever returned
thence alive, and no one may enter therein unless he brings with
him his craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they proceeded towards the gate.&nbsp; Said Gwrhyr
Gwalstawd Ieithoedd, &ldquo;Is there a porter?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is.&nbsp; And thou, if thy tongue be not mute in thy
head, wherefore dost thou call?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Open the
gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not open it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherefore wilt thou not?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The knife is
in the meat, and the drink is in the horn, and there is revelry
in the hall of Gwrnach the Giant, and except for a craftsman who
brings his craft, the gate will not be opened
to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, porter,&rdquo; then said
Kai, &ldquo;my craft bring I with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
thy craft?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The best burnisher of swords am I
in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go and tell this unto
Gwrnach the Giant, and I will bring thee an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the porter went in, and Gwrnach said to him, &ldquo;Hast
thou any news from the gate?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have.&nbsp;
There is a party at the door of the gate who desire to come
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Didst thou enquire of them if they
possessed any art?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I did enquire,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and one told me that he was well skilled in the
burnishing of swords.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have need of him
then.&nbsp; For <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>some time have I sought for some one
to polish my sword, and could find no one.&nbsp; Let this man
enter, since he brings with him his craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The porter thereupon returned, and opened the gate.&nbsp; And
Kai went in by himself, and he saluted Gwrnach the Giant.&nbsp;
And a chair was placed for him opposite to Gwrnach.&nbsp; And
Gwrnach said to him, &ldquo;Oh man! is it true that is reported
of thee that thou knowest how to burnish swords?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know full well how to do so,&rdquo; answered Kai.&nbsp;
Then was the sword of Gwrnach brought to him.&nbsp; And Kai took
a blue whetstone from under his arm, and asked him whether he
would have it burnished white or blue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do with it as
it seems good to thee, and as thou wouldest if it were thine
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Kai polished one half of the blade and put
it in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will this please thee?&rdquo; asked
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would rather than all that is in my dominions
that the whole of it were like unto this.&nbsp; It is a marvel to
me that such a man as thou should be without a
companion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! noble sir, I have a companion,
albeit he is not skilled in this art.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who may
he be?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the porter go forth, and I will
tell him whereby he may know him.&nbsp; The head of his lance
will leave its shaft, and draw blood from the wind, and will
descend upon its shaft again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the gate was
opened, and Bedwyr entered.&nbsp; And Kai said, &ldquo;Bedwyr is
very skilful, although he knows not this art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there was much discourse among those who were without,
because that Kai and Bedwyr had gone in.&nbsp; And a young man
who was with them, the only son of Custennin the herdsman, got in
also.&nbsp; And he caused all his companions to keep close to him
as he passed the three wards, and until he came <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>into the
midst of the castle. <a name="citation98a"></a><a
href="#footnote98a" class="citation">[98a]</a>&nbsp; And his
companions said unto the son of Custennin, &ldquo;Thou hast done
this!&nbsp; Thou art the best of all men.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
thenceforth he was called Goreu, the son of Custennin.&nbsp; Then
they dispersed to their lodgings, that they might slay those who
lodged therein, unknown to the Giant.</p>
<p>The sword was now polished, and Kai gave it unto the hand of
Gwrnach the Giant, to see if he were pleased with his work.&nbsp;
And the Giant said, &ldquo;The work is good, I am content
therewith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Kai, &ldquo;It is thy scabbard that
hath rusted thy sword; give it to me that I may take out the
wooden sides of it, and put in new ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he took
the scabbard from him, and the sword in the other hand.&nbsp; And
he came and stood over against the Giant, as if he would have put
the sword into the scabbard; and with it he struck at the head of
the Giant, and cut off his head at one blow.&nbsp; Then they
despoiled the castle, and took from it what goods and jewels they
would.&nbsp; And again on the same day, at the beginning of the
year, they came to Arthur&rsquo;s Court, bearing with them the
sword of Gwrnach the Giant.</p>
<p>Now when they had told Arthur how they had sped, Arthur said,
&ldquo;Which of these marvels will it be best for us to seek
first?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be best,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;to seek Mabon the son of Modron; and he will not be found
unless we first find Eidoel, the son of Aer, his
kinsman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Arthur rose up, and the warriors of
the Islands of Britain with him, to seek for Eidoel; and they
proceeded until they came before the Castle of Glivi, <a
name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a> where Eidoel was imprisoned.&nbsp;
<!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>Glivi <a name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a> stood on the summit of his Castle, and
he said, &ldquo;Arthur, what requirest thou of me, since nothing
remains to me in this fortress, and I have neither joy nor
pleasure in it; neither wheat nor oats?&nbsp; Seek not therefore
to do me harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Arthur, &ldquo;Not to injure
thee came I hither, but to seek for the prisoner that is with
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will give thee my prisoner, though I
had not thought to give him up to any one; and therewith shall
thou have my support and my aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His followers said unto Arthur, &ldquo;Lord, go thou home,
thou canst not proceed with thy host in quest of such small
adventures as these.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Arthur, &ldquo;It
were well for thee, Gwrhyr Gwalstawd Iethoedd, to go upon this
quest, for thou knowest all languages, and art familiar with <a
name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a> those of the birds and the
beasts.&nbsp; Thou Eidoel oughtest likewise to go with my men in
search of thy cousin.&nbsp; And as for you, Kai and Bedwyr, I
have hope of whatever adventure ye are in quest of, that ye will
achieve it.&nbsp; Achieve ye this adventure for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went forward until they came to the Ousel of
Cilgwri.&nbsp; And Gwrhyr adjured her for the sake of Heaven,
saying, &ldquo;Tell me if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of
Modron, who was taken when three nights old from between his
mother and the wall.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Ousel answered,
&ldquo;When I first came here, there was a smith&rsquo;s anvil in
this place, and I was then a young bird; and from that time no
work has been done upon it, save the pecking of my beak every
evening, and now there is not so much as the size of a nut
remaining thereof; yet the vengeance of Heaven be upon me, if
during all that time I have ever heard of the man for whom you
enquire.&nbsp; <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Nevertheless I will do that which is
right, and that which it is fitting that I should do for an
embassy from Arthur.&nbsp; There is a race of animals who were
formed before me, and I will be your guide to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of
Redynvre.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stag of Redynvre, behold we are come to
thee, an embassy from Arthur, for we have not heard of any animal
older than thou.&nbsp; Say, knowest thou aught of Mabon the son
of Modron, who was taken from his mother when three nights
old?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Stag said, &ldquo;When first I came hither,
there was a plain all around me, without any trees save one oak
sapling, <a name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a> which grew up to be an oak with an
hundred branches.&nbsp; And that oak has since perished, so that
now nothing remains of it but the withered stump; and from that
day to this I have been here, yet have I never heard of the man
for whom you enquire.&nbsp; Nevertheless, being an embassy from
Arthur, I will be your guide to the place where there is an
animal which was formed before I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they proceeded to the place where was the Owl of Cwm
Cawlwyd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd, here is an embassy from
Arthur; knowest thou aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was
taken after three nights from his mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If
I knew I would tell you.&nbsp; When first I came hither, the wide
valley you see was a wooded glen.&nbsp; And a race of men came
and rooted it up.&nbsp; And there grew there a second wood; and
this wood is the third.&nbsp; My wings, are they not withered
stumps?&nbsp; Yet all this time, even until to-day, I have never
heard of the man for whom you enquire.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I will
be the guide of Arthur&rsquo;s embassy until you come to the
place where is the oldest animal <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>in this
world, and the one that has travelled most, the Eagle of Gwern
Abwy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwrhyr said, &ldquo;Eagle of Gwern Abwy, we have come to thee
an embassy from Arthur, to ask thee if thou knowest aught of
Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken from his mother when he
was three nights old.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Eagle said, &ldquo;I have
been here for a great space of time, and when I first came hither
there was a rock here, from the top of which I pecked at the
stars every evening; and now it is not so much as a span
high.&nbsp; From that day to this I have been here, and I have
never heard of the man for whom you enquire, except once when I
went in search of food as far as Llyn Llyw.&nbsp; And when I came
there, I struck my talons into a salmon, thinking he would serve
me as food for a long time.&nbsp; But he drew me into the deep,
and I was scarcely able to escape from him.&nbsp; After that I
went with my whole kindred to attack him, and to try to destroy
him, but he sent messengers, and made peace with me; and came and
besought me to take fifty fish spears out of his back.&nbsp;
Unless he know something of him whom you seek, I cannot tell who
may.&nbsp; However, I will guide you to the place where he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went thither; and the Eagle said, &ldquo;Salmon of
Llyn Llyw, I have come to thee with an embassy from Arthur, to
ask thee if thou knowest aught concerning Mabon the son of
Modron, who was taken away at three nights old from his
mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As much as I know I will tell
thee.&nbsp; With every tide I go along the river upwards, until I
come near to the walls of Gloucester, and there have I found such
wrong as I never found elsewhere; and to the end that ye may give
credence thereto, let one of you go thither upon each of my two
shoulders.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Kai and Gwrhyr <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Gwalstawd
Ieithoedd went upon the two shoulders of the salmon, and they
proceeded until they came unto the wall of the prison, and they
heard a great wailing and lamenting from the dungeon. <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a>&nbsp; Said Gwrhyr, &ldquo;Who is it
that laments in this house of stone?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas,
there is reason enough for whoever is here to lament.&nbsp; It is
Mabon the son of Modron who is here imprisoned, and no
imprisonment was ever so grievous as mine, neither that of Lludd
Llaw Ereint, nor that of Greid the son of Eri.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hast thou hope of being released for gold, or for silver,
or for any gifts of wealth, or through battle and
fighting?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By fighting will whatever I may
gain be obtained.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Then they went thence, and returned to Arthur, and they
told him where Mabon the son of Modron was imprisoned.&nbsp; And
Arthur summoned the warriors of the Island, and they journeyed as
far as Gloucester, to the place where Mabon was in prison.&nbsp;
Kai and Bedwyr went upon the shoulders of the fish, whilst the
warriors of Arthur attacked the castle.&nbsp; And Kai broke
through the wall into the dungeon, and brought away the prisoner
upon his back, whilst the fight was going on between the
warriors.&nbsp; And Arthur returned home, and Mabon with him at
liberty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Said Arthur, &ldquo;Which of the marvels will it be best for
us now to seek first?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be best to seek
for the two cubs of Gast Rhymhi.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
known,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;where she is?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is in Aber Deu Gleddyf,&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; Then
Arthur went to the house of Tringad, in Aber Cleddyf, and he
enquired of him whether he had heard of her there.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In what form may she be?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She is in the
form of a she wolf,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and with her there are
two cubs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She has often slain my herds, and
she is there below in a cave in Aber Cleddyf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Arthur went in his ship Prydwen by sea, and the others went
by land, to hunt her.&nbsp; And they surrounded her and her two
cubs, and God did change them again for Arthur into their own
form.&nbsp; And the host of Arthur dispersed themselves into
parties of one and two.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On a certain day, as Gwythyr the son of Greidawl was walking
over a mountain, he heard a wailing and a grievous cry.&nbsp; And
when he heard it, <a name="citation103"></a><a

there, he drew his sword, and smote off an ant-hill close to the
earth, whereby it escaped being burned in the fire.&nbsp; And the
ants said to him, &ldquo;Receive from us the blessing of Heaven,
and that which no man can give we will give thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then they fetched the nine bushels of flax-seed which Yspaddaden
Penkawr had required of Kilhwch, and they brought the full

lame pismire brought in before night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As Kai and Bedwyr sat on a beacon carn on the summit of
Plinlimmon, in the highest wind that ever was in the world, they
looked around them, and saw a great smoke towards the south, afar
off, which did not bend with the wind.&nbsp; Then said Kai,
&ldquo;By the hand of my friend, behold, yonder is the fire of a
robber!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they hastened towards the smoke, and
they came so near to it, that they could see Dillus Varvawc
scorching a wild Boar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, yonder is the
greatest robber that ever fled from Arthur,&rdquo; said Bedwyr
unto Kai.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dost thou know him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do know him,&rdquo; answered Kai, &ldquo;he is Dillus Varvawc,
and no leash in the world will be able to hold Drudwyn, the cub
of Greid the son of Eri, save a leash made from the beard of him
thou seest yonder.&nbsp; And that even will be useless, unless
his beard be plucked alive with wooden tweezers; for if dead, it
will be brittle.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What thinkest thou that we
should do concerning this?&rdquo; said Bedwyr.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
us suffer him,&rdquo; said Kai, &ldquo;to eat as much as he will
of the meat, and after that he will fall asleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
during that time they employed themselves in making the wooden
tweezers.&nbsp; And when Kai knew certainly that he was asleep,
he made a pit under his feet, the largest <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>in the
world, and he struck him a violent blow, and squeezed him into
the pit.&nbsp; And there they twitched out his beard completely
with the wooden tweezers; and after that they slew him
altogether.</p>
<p>And from thence they both went to Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, and
took the leash made of Dillus Varvawc&rsquo;s beard with them,
and they gave it unto Arthur&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Then Arthur composed this Englyn,</p>
<blockquote><p>Kai made a leash<br />
Of Dillus son of Eurei&rsquo;s beard.<br />
Were he alive, thy death he&rsquo;d be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thereupon Kai was wroth, so that the warriors of the
Island could scarcely make peace between Kai and Arthur.&nbsp;
And thenceforth, neither in Arthur&rsquo;s troubles, nor for the
slaying of his men, would Kai come forward to his aid for ever
after.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Said Arthur, &ldquo;Which of the marvels is it best for us now
to seek?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is best for us to seek Drudwyn,
the cub of Greid, the son of Eri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little while before this, Creiddylad, the daughter of Lludd
Llaw Ereint, and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl, were
betrothed.&nbsp; And before she had become his bride, Gwyn ap
Nudd came, and carried her away by force; and Gwythyr the son of
Greidawl gathered his host together, and went to fight with Gwyn
ap Nudd.&nbsp; But Gwyn overcame him, and captured Greid the son
of Eri, and Glinneu the son of Taran and Gwrgwst Ledlwm, and
Dynvarth <a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a> his son.&nbsp; And he captured Penn
the son of Nethawg, and Nwython, and Kyledyr Wyllt his son.&nbsp;
And they slew Nwython, and took out his heart, and constrained
Kyledyr to eat the heart of <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>his
father.&nbsp; And therefrom Kyledyr became mad.&nbsp; When Arthur
heard of this, he went to the North, and summoned Gwyn ap Nudd
before him, and set free the nobles whom he had put in prison,
and made peace between Gwyn ap Nudd and Gwythyr the son of
Greidawl.&nbsp; And this was the peace that was made: that the
maiden should remain in her father&rsquo;s house, without
advantage to either of them, and that Gwyn ap Nudd and Gwythyr
the son of Greidawl should fight for her every first of May, from
thenceforth until the day of doom, and that whichever of them
should then be conqueror should have the maiden.</p>
<p>And when Arthur had thus reconciled these chieftains, he
obtained Mygdwn, Gweddw&rsquo;s horse, and the leash of Cwrs Cant
Ewin.</p>
<p>And after that Arthur went into Armorica, and with him Mabon
the son of Mellt, and Gware Gwallt Euryn, to seek the two dogs of
Glythmyr Ledewic.&nbsp; And when he had got them, he went to the
West of Ireland, in search of Gwrgi Severi; and Odgar the son of
Aedd, king of Ireland, went with him.&nbsp; And thence went
Arthur into the North, and captured Kyledyr Wyllt; and he went
after Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd.&nbsp; And Mabon the son of Mellt came
with the two dogs of Glythmyr Ledewic in his hand, and Drudwyn,
the cub of Greid the son of Eri.&nbsp; And Arthur went himself to
the chase, leading his own dog Cavall.&nbsp; And Kaw, of North
Britain, mounted Arthur&rsquo;s mare Llamrei, and was first in
the attack.&nbsp; Then Kaw, of North Britain, wielded a mighty
axe, and absolutely daring he came valiantly up to the Boar, and
clave his head in twain.&nbsp; And Kaw took away the tusk.&nbsp;
Now the Boar was not slain by the dogs that Yspaddaden had
mentioned, but by Cavall, Arthur&rsquo;s own dog.</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>And after Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd was killed, Arthur and
his host departed to Gelli Wic in Cornwall.&nbsp; And thence he
sent Menw the son of Teirgwaedd to see if the precious things
were between the two ears of Twrch Trwyth, since it were useless
to encounter him if they were not there.&nbsp; Albeit it was
certain where he was, for he had laid waste the third part of
Ireland.&nbsp; And Menw went to seek for him, and he met with him
in Ireland, in Esgeir Oervel.&nbsp; And Menw took the form of a
bird; and he descended upon the top of his lair, and strove to
snatch away one of the precious things from him, but he carried
away nothing but one of his bristles.&nbsp; And the boar rose up
angrily and shook himself so that some of his venom fell upon
Menw, and he was never well from that day forward.</p>
<p>After this Arthur sent an embassy to Odgar, the son of Aedd,
king of Ireland, to ask for the Cauldron of Diwrnach Wyddel, his
purveyor.&nbsp; And Odgar commanded him to give it.&nbsp; But
Diwrnach said, &ldquo;Heaven is my witness, if it would avail him
anything even to look at it, he should not do so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the embassy of Arthur returned from Ireland with this
denial.&nbsp; And Arthur set forward with a small retinue, and
entered into Prydwen, his ship, and went over to Ireland.&nbsp;
And they proceeded into the house of Diwrnach Wyddel.&nbsp; And
the hosts of Odgar saw their strength.&nbsp; When they had eaten
and drank as much as they desired, Arthur demanded to have the
cauldron.&nbsp; And he answered, &ldquo;If I would have given it
to any one, I would have given it at the word of Odgar, king of
Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had given them this denial, Bedwyr arose and seized
hold of the cauldron, and placed it upon the back of Hygwyd,
Arthur&rsquo;s servant, who was <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>brother, by
the mother&rsquo;s side, to Arthur&rsquo;s servant,
Cachamwri.&nbsp; His office was always to carry Arthur&rsquo;s
cauldron, and to place fire under it.&nbsp; And Llenlleawg Wyddel
seized Caledvwlch, and brandished it.&nbsp; And they slew
Diwrnach Wyddel and his company.&nbsp; Then came the Irish, <a
name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a"
class="citation">[108a]</a> and fought with them.&nbsp; And when
he had put them to flight, Arthur with his men went forward to
the ship, carrying away the cauldron full of Irish money. <a
name="citation108b"></a><a href="#footnote108b"
class="citation">[108b]</a>&nbsp; And he disembarked at the house
of Llwydden <a name="citation108c"></a><a href="#footnote108c"
class="citation">[108c]</a> the son of Kelcoed, at Forth Kerddin
in Dyved.&nbsp; And there is the measure of the cauldron.</p>
<p>Then Arthur summoned unto him all the warriors that were in
the three Islands of Britain, and in the three Islands adjacent,
and all that were in France and in Armorica, in Normandy and in
the Summer Country, and all that were chosen footmen and valiant
horsemen.&nbsp; And with all these, he went into Ireland.&nbsp;
And in Ireland there was great fear and terror concerning
him.&nbsp; And when Arthur had landed in the country, there came
unto him the saints of Ireland and besought his protection.&nbsp;
And he granted his protection unto them, and they gave him their
blessing.&nbsp; Then the men of Ireland came unto Arthur, and
brought him provisions.&nbsp; And Arthur went as far as Esgeir
Oervel in Ireland, to the place where the Boar Trwyth was with
his seven young pigs.&nbsp; And the dogs were let loose upon him
from all sides.&nbsp; That day until evening, the Irish fought
with him, nevertheless he laid waste the fifth part of
Ireland.&nbsp; And on the day following the <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>household
of Arthur fought with him, and they were worsted by him, and got
no advantage.&nbsp; And the third day Arthur himself encountered
him, and he fought with him nine nights and nine days without so
much as killing even one little pig. <a name="citation109"></a><a
href="#footnote109" class="citation">[109]</a>&nbsp; The warriors
enquired of Arthur, what was the origin of that swine; and he
told them that he was once a king, and that God had transformed
him into a swine for his sins.</p>
<p>Then Arthur sent Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, to endeavour to
speak with him.&nbsp; And Gwrhyr assumed the form of a bird, and
alighted upon the top of the lair, where he was with the seven
young pigs.&nbsp; And Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd asked him,
&ldquo;By him who turned you into this form, if you can speak,
let some one of you, I beseech you, come and talk with
Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; Grugyn Gwrych Ereint made answer to
him.&nbsp; (Now his bristles were like silver wire, and whether
he went through the wood or through the plain, he was to be
traced by the glittering of his bristles.)&nbsp; And this was the
answer that Grugyn made, &ldquo;By him who turned us into this
form we will not do so, and we will not speak with Arthur.&nbsp;
That we have been transformed thus is enough for us to suffer,
without your coming here to fight with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will tell you.&nbsp; Arthur comes but to fight for the comb, and
the razor, and the scissors, which are between the two ears of
Twrch Trwyth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Grugyn, &ldquo;Except he first
take his life, he will never have those precious things.&nbsp;
And to-morrow morning we will rise up hence, and we will go into
Arthur&rsquo;s country, and there will we do all the mischief
that we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>So they set forth through the sea towards Wales.&nbsp;
And Arthur and his hosts, and his horses and his dogs, entered
Prydwen, that they might encounter them without delay.&nbsp;
Twrch Trwyth landed in Porth Cleis in Dyved, and the <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a> came to Mynyw.&nbsp; The next day it
was told to Arthur, that they had gone by, and he overtook them,
as they were killing the cattle of Kynnwas Kwrr y Vagyl, having
slain all that were at Aber Gleddyf, of man and beast, before the
coming of Arthur.</p>
<p>Now when Arthur approached, Twrch Trwyth went on as far as
Preseleu, and Arthur and his hosts followed him thither, and
Arthur sent men to hunt him; Eli and Trachmyr, leading Drutwyn
the whelp of Greid, the son of Eri, and Gwarthegyd the son of
Kaw, in another quarter, with the two dogs of Glythmyr Ledewig,
and Bedwyr leading Cavall, Arthur&rsquo;s own dog.&nbsp; And all
the warriors ranged themselves around the Nyver.&nbsp; And there
came there the three sons of Cleddyf Divwlch, men who had gained
much fame at the slaying of Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd; and they went
on from Glyn Nyver, and came to Cwm Kerwyn.</p>
<p>And there Twrch Trwyth made a stand, and slew four of
Arthur&rsquo;s champions, Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw, and Tarawc
of Allt Clwyd, and Rheidwn the son of Eli Atver, and Iscovan
Hael.&nbsp; And after he had slain these men, he made a second
stand in the same place.&nbsp; And there he slew Gwydre the son
of Arthur, and Garselit Wyddel, and Glew the son of Ysgawd, and
Iscawn the son of Panon; and there he himself was wounded.</p>
<p>And the next morning before it was day, some of <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>the men came up with him.&nbsp; And he slew Huandaw,
and Gogigwr, and Penpingon, three attendants upon Glewlwyd
Gavaelvawr, so that Heaven knows he had not an attendant
remaining, excepting only Llaesgevyn, a man from whom no one ever
derived any good.&nbsp; And together with these, he slew many of
the men of that country, and Gwlydyn Saer, Arthur&rsquo;s chief
Architect.</p>
<p>Then Arthur overtook him at Pelumyawc, and there he slew
Madawc the son of Teithyon, and Gwyn the son of Tringad, the son
of Neved, and Eiryawn Penllorau.&nbsp; Thence he went to
Aberteivi, <a name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a"
class="citation">[111a]</a> where he made another stand, and
where he slew Kyflas <a name="citation111b"></a><a
href="#footnote111b" class="citation">[111b]</a> the son of
Kynan, and Gwilenhin king of France.&nbsp; Then he went as far as
Glyn Ystu, and there the men and the dogs lost him.</p>
<p>Then Arthur summoned unto him Gwyn ab Nudd, and he asked him
if he knew aught of Twrch Trwyth.&nbsp; And he said that he did
not.</p>
<p>And all the huntsmen went to hunt the swine as far as Dyffryn
Llychwr.&nbsp; And Grugyn Gwallt Ereint, and Llwydawg Govynnyad
closed with them and killed all the huntsmen, so that there
escaped but one man only.&nbsp; And Arthur and his hosts came to
the place where Grugyn and Llwydawg were.&nbsp; And there he let
loose the whole of the dogs upon them, and with the shout and
barking that was set up, Twrch Trwyth came to their
assistance.</p>
<p>And from the time that they came across the Irish sea, Arthur
had never got sight of him until then. <a
name="citation111c"></a><a href="#footnote111c"
class="citation">[111c]</a>&nbsp; So he set men and dogs upon
him, and thereupon he started off and went to Mynydd Amanw.&nbsp;
<!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>And there one of his young pigs was killed. <a
name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a>&nbsp; Then they set upon him life for
life, and Twrch Llawin was slain, and then there was slain
another of the swine, Gwys was his name.&nbsp; After that he went
on to Dyffryn Amanw, and there Banw and Bennwig were killed. <a
name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b"
class="citation">[112b]</a>&nbsp; Of all his pigs there went with
him alive from that place none save Grugyn Gwallt Ereint, and
Llwydawg Govynnyad.</p>
<p>Thence he went on to Llwch Ewin, and Arthur overtook him
there, and he made a stand.&nbsp; And there he slew Echel
Forddwytwll, and Garwyli the son of Gwyddawg Gwyr, and many men
and dogs likewise.&nbsp; And thence they went to Llwch
Tawy.&nbsp; Grugyn Gwrych Ereint parted from them there, and went
to Din Tywi.&nbsp; And thence he proceeded to Ceredigiawn, and
Eli and Trachmyr with him, and a multitude likewise.&nbsp; Then
he came to Garth Gregyn, and there Llwydawg Govynnyad fought in
the midst of them, and slew Rhudvyw Rhys and many others with
him.&nbsp; Then Llwydawg went thence to Ystrad Yw, and there the
men of Armorica met him, and there he slew Hirpeissawg, the king
of Armorica, and Llygatrudd Emys, and Gwrbothu, Arthur&rsquo;s
uncles, his mother&rsquo;s brothers, and there was he himself
slain.</p>
<p>Twrch Trwyth went from there to between Tawy and Euyas, and
Arthur summoned all Cornwall and Devon unto him, to the estuary
of the Severn, and he said to the warriors of this Island,
&ldquo;Twrch Trwyth has slain many of my men, but, by the valour
of warriors, while I live he shall not go into Cornwall.&nbsp;
And I will not follow him any longer, but I will oppose him life
to life.&nbsp; Do ye as ye will.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he resolved
that he would send a body of knights, with <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the dogs of
the Island, as far as Euyas, who should return thence to the
Severn, and that tried warriors should traverse the Island, and
force him into the Severn.&nbsp; And Mabon the son of Modron came
up with him at the Severn, upon Gwynn Mygddon, the horse of
Gweddw, and Goreu the son of Custennin, and Menw the son of
Teirgwaedd; this was betwixt Llyn Lliwan and Aber Gwy.&nbsp; And
Arthur fell upon him together with the champions of
Britain.&nbsp; And Osla Kyllellvawr drew near, and Manawyddan the
son of Llyr, and Kacmwri the servant of Arthur, and Gwyngelli,
and they seized hold of him, catching him first by his feet, and
plunged him in the Severn, so that it overwhelmed him.&nbsp; On
the one side, Mabon the son of Modron spurred his steed and
snatched his razor from him, and Kyledyr Wyllt came up with him
on the other side, upon another steed, in the Severn, and took
from him the scissors.&nbsp; But before they could obtain the
comb, he had regained the ground with his feet, and from the
moment that he reached the shore, neither dog, nor man, nor horse
could overtake him until he came to Cornwall.&nbsp; If they had
had trouble in getting the jewels from him, much more had they in
seeking to save the two men from being drowned.&nbsp; Kacmwri, as
they drew him forth, was dragged by two millstones into the
deep.&nbsp; And as Osla Kyllellvawr was running after the Boar
his knife had dropped out of the sheath, and he had lost it, and
after that the sheath became full of water, and its weight drew
him down into the deep, as they were drawing him forth.</p>
<p>Then Arthur and his hosts proceeded until they overtook the
Boar in Cornwall, and the trouble which they had met with before
was mere play to what they encountered in seeking the comb.&nbsp;
But from one <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>difficulty to another, the comb was
at length obtained.&nbsp; And then he was hunted from Cornwall,
and driven straight forward into the deep sea.&nbsp; And
thenceforth it was never known whither he went; and Aned and
Aethlem with him.&nbsp; Then went Arthur to Gelliwic, in
Cornwall, to anoint himself, and to rest from his fatigues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Said Arthur, &ldquo;Is there any one of the marvels yet
unobtained?&rdquo;&nbsp; Said one of his men, &ldquo;There
is&mdash;the blood of the witch Orddu, the daughter of the witch
Orwen, of Penn Nant Govid, on the confines of Hell.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Arthur set forth towards the North, and came to the place where
was the witch&rsquo;s cave.&nbsp; And Gwyn ab Nudd, and Gwythyr
the son of Greidawl, counselled him to send Kacmwri, and Hygwyd
his brother to fight with the witch.&nbsp; And as they entered
the cave, the witch seized upon them, and she caught Hygwyd by
the hair of his head, and threw him on the floor beneath
her.&nbsp; And Kacmwri caught her by the hair of her head, and
dragged her to the earth from off Hygwyd, but she turned again
upon them both, <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a> and drove them both out with kicks and
with cuffs.</p>
<p>And Arthur was wroth at seeing his two attendants almost
slain, and he sought to enter the cave; but Gwyn and Gwythyr said
unto him, &ldquo;It would not be fitting or seemly for us to see
thee squabbling with a hag.&nbsp; Let Hiramren, and Hireidil go
to the cave.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they went.&nbsp; But if great was
the trouble of the two first that went, much greater was that of
these two.&nbsp; And Heaven knows that not one of the four could
move from the spot, until they placed them all upon Llamrei,
Arthur&rsquo;s mare.&nbsp; And then Arthur rushed to the door of
the cave, and at the door, he struck at <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>the witch,
with Carnwennan his dagger, and clove her in twain, so that she
fell in two parts.&nbsp; And Kaw, of North Britain, took the
blood of the witch and kept it.</p>
<p>Then Kilhwch set forward, and Goreu, the son of Custennin,
with him, and as many as wished ill to Yspaddaden Penkawr.&nbsp;
And they took the marvels with them to his Court.&nbsp; And Kaw
of North Britain came and shaved his beard, skin and flesh, clean
off to the very bone from ear to ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art thou
shaved, man?&rdquo; said Kilhwch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
shaved,&rdquo; answered he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is thy daughter mine
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She is thine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
therefore needest thou not thank me, but Arthur who hath
accomplished this for thee.&nbsp; By my free will thou shouldest
never have had her, for with her I lose my life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then Goreu the son of Custennin, seized him by the hair of his
head, and dragged him after him to the keep, and cut off his
head, and placed it on a stake on the citadel.&nbsp; Then they
took possession of his castle, and of his treasures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p115.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>And that night Olwen became Kilhwch&rsquo;s bride, and she
continued to be his wife as long as she lived.&nbsp; And the
hosts of Arthur dispersed themselves, each man to his own
country.&nbsp; And thus did Kilhwch obtain Olwen the daughter of
Yspaddaden Penkawr.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Maxen Wledig was emperor of Rome, and he was a comelier man,
and a better and a wiser than any emperor that had been before
him. <a name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a>&nbsp; And one day he held a council of
Kings, and he said to his friends, &ldquo;I desire to go
to-morrow to hunt.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the next day in the morning
he set forth with his retinue, and came to the valley of the
river that flowed towards Rome.&nbsp; And he hunted through the
valley until mid-day.&nbsp; And with him also were two and thirty
crowned kings, that were his vassals; not for the <!-- page
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>delight of hunting went the emperor with them, but to
put himself on equal terms with those kings. <a
name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117"
class="citation">[117]</a></p>
<p>And the sun was high in the sky over their heads, and the heat
was great.&nbsp; And sleep came upon Maxen Wledig.&nbsp; And his
attendants stood and set up their shields around him upon the
shafts of their spears to protect him from the sun, and they
placed a gold enamelled shield under his head, and so Maxen
slept.</p>
<p>And he saw a dream.&nbsp; And this is the dream that he
saw.&nbsp; He was journeying along the valley of the river
towards its source; and he came to the highest mountain in the
world.&nbsp; And he thought that the mountain was as high as the
sky; and when he came over the mountain, it seemed to him that he
went through the fairest and most level regions that man ever yet
beheld, on the other side of the mountain.&nbsp; And he saw large
and mighty rivers descending from the mountain to the sea, and
towards the mouths of the rivers he proceeded.&nbsp; And as he
journeyed thus, he came to the mouth of the largest river ever
seen.&nbsp; And he beheld a great city at the entrance of the
river, and a vast castle in the city, and he saw many high towers
of various colours in the castle.&nbsp; And he saw a fleet at the
mouth of the river, the largest ever seen.&nbsp; And he saw one
ship among the fleet; larger was it by far, and fairer than all
the others.&nbsp; Of such part of the ship as he could see above
the water, one plank was gilded and the other silvered
over.&nbsp; He saw a bridge of the bone of the whale from the
ship to the land, and he thought that he went along the bridge
and came into the ship.&nbsp; And a sail was hoisted on the ship,
and along the sea and the ocean was it borne.&nbsp; Then it
seemed that he came to the fairest <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>island in
the whole world, and he traversed the island from sea to sea,
even to the farthest shore of the island.&nbsp; Valleys he saw,
and steeps, and rocks of wondrous height, and rugged precipices.
<a name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a>&nbsp; Never yet saw he the
like.&nbsp; And thence he beheld an island in the sea, facing
this rugged <a name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b"
class="citation">[118b]</a> land.&nbsp; And between him and this
island was a country of which the plain was as large as the sea,
the mountain as vast as the wood.&nbsp; And from the mountain he
saw a river that flowed through the land and fell into the
sea.&nbsp; And at the mouth of the river, he beheld a castle, the
fairest that man ever saw, and the gate of the castle was open,
and he went into the castle.&nbsp; And in the castle he saw a
fair hall of which the roof seemed to be all gold, the walls of
the hall seemed to be entirely of glittering precious gems, the
doors all seemed to be of gold.&nbsp; Golden seats he saw in the
hall, and silver tables.&nbsp; And on a seat opposite to him, he
beheld two auburn-haired youths playing at chess.&nbsp; He saw a
silver board <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>for the chess, and golden pieces
thereon.&nbsp; The garments of the youths were of jet black
satin, and chaplets of ruddy gold bound their hair, whereon were
sparkling jewels of great price, <a name="citation119"></a><a
href="#footnote119" class="citation">[119]</a> rubies, and gems,
alternately with imperial stones.&nbsp; Buskins of new cordovan
leather on their feet, fastened by slides of red gold.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p118.jpg">

<p>And beside a pillar in the hall he saw a hoary-headed man, in
a chair of ivory, with the figures of two eagles of ruddy gold
thereon.&nbsp; Bracelets of gold were upon his arms, and many
rings upon his hands, and a golden torquis about his neck; and
his hair was bound with a golden diadem.&nbsp; He was of powerful
aspect.&nbsp; A chessboard of gold was before him, and a rod of
gold, and a steel file in his hand.&nbsp; And he was carving out
chessmen.</p>
<p>And he saw a maiden sitting before him in a chair of ruddy
gold.&nbsp; Not more easy than to gaze upon the sun when
brightest, was it to look upon her by reason of her beauty.&nbsp;
A vest of white silk was upon the maiden, with clasps of red gold
at the breast; and a surcoat of gold tissue was upon her, and a
frontlet of red gold upon her head, and rubies and gems were in
the frontlet, alternating with pearls and imperial stones.&nbsp;
And a girdle of ruddy gold was around her.&nbsp; She was the
fairest sight that man ever beheld.</p>
<p>The maiden arose from her chair before him, and he threw his
arms about the neck of the maiden, and they two sat down together
in the chair of gold: and the chair was not less roomy for them
both, than for the maiden alone.&nbsp; And as he had his arms
about the maiden&rsquo;s neck, and his cheek by her cheek,
behold, through the chafing of the dogs at their leashing, and
the clashing of the shields as they struck against each <!-- page

120</span>other, and the beating together of the shafts of the
spears, and the neighing of the horses and their prancing, the
emperor awoke.</p>
<p>And when he awoke, nor spirit nor existence was left him,
because of the maiden whom he had seen in his sleep, for the love
of the maiden pervaded his whole frame. <a
name="citation120"></a><a href="#footnote120"
class="citation">[120]</a>&nbsp; Then his household spake unto
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said they &ldquo;is it not past
the time for thee to take thy food?&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the
emperor mounted his palfrey, the saddest man that mortal ever
saw, and went forth towards Rome.</p>
<p>And thus he was during the space of a week.&nbsp; When they of
the household went to drink wine and mead out of golden vessels,
he went not with any of them.&nbsp; When they went to listen to
songs and tales, he went not with them there; neither could he be
persuaded to do anything but sleep.&nbsp; And as often as he
slept, he beheld in his dreams the maiden he loved best; but
except when he slept he saw nothing of her, for he knew not where
in the world she was.</p>
<p>One day the page of the chamber spake unto him; now, although
he was page of the chamber, he was king of the Romans.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all thy people revile
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore do they revile me?&rdquo;
asked the emperor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because they can get neither
message nor answer from thee, as men should have from their
lord.&nbsp; This is the cause why thou art spoken evil
of.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Youth,&rdquo; said the emperor, &ldquo;do
thou bring unto me the wise men of Rome, and I will tell them
wherefore I am sorrowful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the wise men of Rome were brought to the emperor, and he
spake to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sages of Rome,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I have seen a dream.&nbsp; And in the dream I <!-- page
121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>beheld a maiden, and because of the maiden is there
neither life, nor spirit, nor existence within me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;since thou judgest us
worthy to counsel thee, we will give thee counsel.&nbsp; And this
is our counsel; that thou send messengers for three years to the
three parts of the world, to seek for thy dream.&nbsp; And as
thou knowest not what day or what night good news may come to
thee, the hope thereof will support thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the messengers journeyed for the space of a year wandering
about the world, and seeking tidings concerning his dream.&nbsp;
But when they came back at the end of the year they knew not one
word more than they did the day they set forth.&nbsp; And then
was the emperor exceeding sorrowful, for he thought that he
should never have tidings of her whom best he loved.</p>
<p>Then spoke the king of the Romans unto the emperor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;go forth to hunt by the way
that thou didst seem to go, whither it were to the east or to the
west.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the emperor went forth to hunt, and he came
to the bank of the river.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;this is where I was when I saw the dream, and I went
towards the source of the river westward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon thirteen messengers of the emperor&rsquo;s set
forth, and before them they saw a high mountain, which seemed to
them to touch the sky.&nbsp; Now this was the guise in which the
messengers journeyed; one sleeve was on the cap of each of them
in front; as a sign that they were messengers, in order that
through what hostile land soever they might pass no harm might be
done them.&nbsp; And when they were come over this mountain they
beheld vast plains, and large rivers flowing therethrough.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;the land which our master
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>And they went along the mouths of the rivers, until
they came to the mighty river which they saw flowing to the sea,
and the vast city, and the many-coloured high towers in the
castle.&nbsp; They saw the largest fleet in the world, in the
harbour of the river, and one ship that was larger than any of
the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold again,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;the dream that our master saw.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the
great ship they crossed the sea, and came to the Island of
Britain.&nbsp; And they traversed the island until they came to
Snowdon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;the rugged
<a name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122"
class="citation">[122]</a> land that our master saw.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And they went forward until they saw Anglesey before them, and
until they saw Arvon likewise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said
they, &ldquo;the land our master saw in his sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And they saw Aber Sain, and a castle at the mouth of the
river.&nbsp; The portal of the castle saw they open, and into the
castle they went, and they saw a hall in the castle.&nbsp; Then
said they, &ldquo;Behold the hall which he saw in his
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went into the hall, and they beheld two youths playing at
chess on the golden bench.&nbsp; And they beheld the hoary-headed
man beside the pillar, in the ivory chair, carving
chessmen.&nbsp; And they beheld the maiden sitting on a chair of
ruddy gold.</p>
<p>The messengers bent down upon their knees.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Empress of Rome, all hail!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha,
gentles,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;ye bear the seeming of
honourable men, and the badge of envoys, what mockery is this ye
do to me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We mock thee not, lady, but the
emperor of Rome hath seen thee in his sleep, and he has neither
life nor spirit left because of thee.&nbsp; Thou shall have of us
therefore the choice, lady, whether thou wilt go with us and be
made empress of Rome, or that the emperor come hither and take
thee for his wife?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, lords,&rdquo; said the
maiden, &ldquo;I will not deny what <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>you say,
neither will I believe it too well.&nbsp; If the emperor love me,
let him come here to seek me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by day and night the messengers hied them back.&nbsp; And
when their horses failed, they bought other fresh ones.&nbsp; And
when they came to Rome they saluted the emperor, and asked their
boon, which was given to them according as they named it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We will be thy guides, lord,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;over
sea and over land, to the place where is the woman whom best thou
lovest, for we know her name, and her kindred, and her
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p123.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p123.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And immediately the emperor set forth with his army.&nbsp; And
these men were his guides.&nbsp; Towards the Island of Britain
they went over the sea and the deep.&nbsp; And he conquered the
Island from Beli the son of Manogan, and his sons, and drove them
to the sea, and went forward even unto Arvon.&nbsp; And the <!--
page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>emperor knew the land when he saw it.&nbsp; And when he
beheld the castle of Aber Sain, &ldquo;Look yonder,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;there is the castle wherein I saw the damsel whom I
best love.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he went forward into the castle and
into the hall, and there he saw Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon
the son of Eudav, playing at chess.&nbsp; And he saw Eudav the
son of Caradawc, sitting on a chair of ivory carving
chessmen.&nbsp; And the maiden whom he had beheld in his sleep,
he saw sitting on a chair of gold.&nbsp; &ldquo;Empress of
Rome,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all hail!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
emperor threw his arms about her neck; and that night she became
his bride.</p>
<p>And the next day in the morning, the damsel asked her maiden
portion.&nbsp; And he told her to name what she would, and she
asked to have the Island of Britain for her father, from the
Channel to the Irish Sea, together with the three adjacent
islands to hold under the empress of Rome; and to have three
chief castles made for her, in whatever places she might choose
in the Island of Britain.&nbsp; And she chose to have the highest
castle made at Arvon.&nbsp; And they brought thither earth from
Rome that it might be more healthful for the emperor to sleep,
and sit, and walk upon.&nbsp; After that the two other castles
were made for her, which were Caerlleon and Caermarthen.</p>
<p>And one day, the emperor went to hunt at Caermarthen, and he
came so far as the top of Brevi Vawr, and there the emperor
pitched his tent.&nbsp; And that encamping place is called Cadeir
Maxen, even to this day.&nbsp; And because that he built the
castle with a myriad of men, he called it Caervyrddin.&nbsp; Then
Helen bethought her to make high roads from one castle to another
throughout the Island of Britain.&nbsp; And the roads were
made.&nbsp; And for this cause are they called the roads of Helen
Luyddawc, <a name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a> that she <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>was sprung
from a native of this island, and the men of the Island of
Britain would not have made these great roads <a
name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"
class="citation">[125]</a> for any save for her.</p>
<p>Seven years did the emperor tarry in this Island.&nbsp; Now,
at that time, the men of Rome had a custom that whatsoever
emperor should remain in other lands more than seven years,
should remain to his own overthrow, and should never return to
Rome again.</p>
<p>So they made a new emperor.&nbsp; And this one wrote a letter
of threat to Maxen.&nbsp; There was nought in the letter but only
this, &ldquo;If thou comest, and if thou ever comest to
Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; And even unto Caerlleon came this letter to
Maxen, and these tidings.&nbsp; Then sent he a letter to the man
who styled himself emperor in Rome.&nbsp; There was nought in
that letter also but only this, &ldquo;If I come to Rome, and if
I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon Maxen set forth towards Rome with his army, and
vanquished France and Burgundy, and every land on the way, and
sat down before the city of Rome.</p>
<p>A year was the emperor before the city, and he was no nearer
taking it than the first day.&nbsp; And after him there came the
brothers of Helen Luyddawc from the Island of Britain, and a
small host with them, and better warriors were in that small host
than twice as many Romans.&nbsp; And the emperor was told that a
host was seen, halting close to his army and encamping, and no
man ever saw a fairer or better appointed host for its size, nor
more handsome standards.</p>
<p>And Helen went to see the hosts, and she knew the standards of
her brothers.&nbsp; Then came Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon
the son of Eudav, to meet the emperor.&nbsp; And the emperor was
glad because of them, and embraced them.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Then they looked at the Romans as they attacked the
city.&nbsp; Said Kynan to his brother, &ldquo;We will try to
attack the city more expertly than this.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they
measured by night the height of the wall, and they sent their
carpenters to the wood, and a ladder was made for every four men
of their number.&nbsp; Now when these were ready, every day at
mid-day the emperors went to meat, and they ceased to fight on
both sides till all had finished eating.&nbsp; And in the morning
the men of Britain took their food, and they drank until they
were invigorated.&nbsp; And while the two emperors were at meat,
the Britons came to the city, <a name="citation126a"></a><a
href="#footnote126a" class="citation">[126a]</a> and placed their
ladders against it, and forthwith they came in through the
city.</p>
<p>The new emperor had not time to arm himself when they fell
upon him, and slew him and many others with him.&nbsp; And three
nights and three days were they subduing the men that were in the
city and taking the castle.&nbsp; And others of them kept the
city, lest any of the host of Maxen should come therein, until
they had subjected all to their will.</p>
<p>Then spake Maxen to Helen Luyddawc, &ldquo;I marvel,
lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that thy brothers have not conquered
this city for me.&rdquo; <a name="citation126b"></a><a
href="#footnote126b" class="citation">[126b]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord, emperor,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;the wisest
youths in the world are my brothers.&nbsp; Go thou thither and
ask the city of them, and if it be in their possession thou shalt
have it gladly.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the emperor and Helen went and
demanded the city.&nbsp; And they told the emperor that none had
taken the city, and that none could give it him, but the men of
the Island of Britain.&nbsp; Then the gates of the city of Rome
were opened, and the emperor sat on the throne and all the men of
Rome submitted themselves unto him.</p>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>The emperor then said unto Kynan and Adeon,
&ldquo;Lords,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have now had possession of
the whole of my empire.&nbsp; This host give I unto you to
vanquish whatever region ye may desire in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they set forth and conquered lands, and castles and
cities.&nbsp; And they slew all the men, but the women they kept
alive.&nbsp; And thus they continued until the young men that had
come with them were grown grey headed, from the length of time
they were upon this conquest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p127.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p127.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Then spoke Kynan unto Adeon his brother, &ldquo;Whether wilt
thou rather,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tarry in this land, or go
back into the land whence thou didst come forth?&rdquo;&nbsp; Now
he chose to go back to his own land and many with him.&nbsp; But
Kynan tarried there with the other part, and dwelt there.</p>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>And they took counsel and cut out the tongues of the
women, lest they should corrupt their speech.&nbsp; And because
of the silence of the women from their own speech, the men of
Armorica are called Britons.&nbsp; From that time there came
frequently, and still comes, that language from the Island of
Britain.</p>
<p>And this tale is called the Dream of Maxen Wledig, emperor of
Rome.&nbsp; And here it ends.</p>
